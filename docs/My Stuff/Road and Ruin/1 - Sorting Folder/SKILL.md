The stance ends when Immobilize does, and costs 1 Endurance as payment.<br><br>While in a stance and Immobilized, you may still move via Maneuvers, and stances grant one additional success on attempts to resist displacement, falling prone, or staggering. |
| RANK 5 | FORMLESS FORTRESS<br>                   | _Brick by brick, and soul by soul, a new foundation of the Halls of Consequences is laid._<br><br>Once per day, as a special action, gain a Premeditated DIST4 boon of a value queal to the sum of your worn armor value, plus the number of allies within 10 combined meters away.

Each favor creates 1MP worth of conjure, or one Size worth of swarm per favor and Prep point spent.<br><br>Spiders that you control produce a venom, chosen when you gain this ability:<br><br>**Brimstone Bites:** On special, the spider inflicts Burning IMM3, of value one-third of X, rounded down, to a minimum of 1, where X is the largest of points spent, success difference, or Immobilize value.<br><br>**Cobwebbed Cognition:** On special, inflict Befuddled IMM3, causing Curse on the target's skill checks, saves, or concentration, ov value equal to half the points spent, IMM value, or battle of wills success difference.<br><br>---<br><br>Whenever you spend the favor of a demon, god, fae, or spirit, you may gain a Prep point or add +1 to an ongoing Premeditated boon, in the name of enacting it's Will. Gireth allows this to locate an influential or specializing individual, who can be leveraged for your personal goals, in the same way that Prep points may retroactively create traps, and restores spent favor upon perfomance of a deed to bring glory to the Spider God.<br> |

Each crescendo concentration success, plus mana allocated on a failed success, keeps the effect going, and all elements and beings return to their original state once the effect is ended.<br><br>If a feature already grants you this feature, instead gain specialization +1 in that action, and gain Resistance +1 against damage from that element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Yet, it can be gently convinced to take up the mantle of starstuff once more._<br><br>You learn how to create hyper-dense masses of pure mana. You may create a single 10-mana cluster at a time.<br><br>---<br><br>For 10 Craft(Mana) successes, at a rate of one roll per day, you may transfer up to 10 of your physical, mental, and social attributes into an artifact, that you link to immediately on creation.<br><br>- This stone may store up to 10MP on it's own, and recovers mana each day based on the rules of mental attributes for the attributes transfered to it.<br>- The stone is considered to have a quality equal to half the mana contained within it.<br>- Whenever a spell is cast using the stone's mana, with the stone as the origin point, roll an Intelligence check, with the related skill and artifact proficiency bonuses. The spell is cast at maximum cluster value, for an amount of mana equal to 5 minus your successes on the roll, to a minimum of spell's lowest cost.<br>- The stone may act as the origin point of a spell that requires maintained concentration, and maintains it in perpetuity. The spell can still be dispelled.<br>- As a non-consumed material component, the stone can be used to freely comprehend all verbal and written languages, as well as converse with magical creatures who may not otherwise know a language of their own.<br><br>---<br><br>You may treat all favored equipment as another item type for the sake of choosing favored traits, and you come to favor one of either enchanted weapons, armor, or tools. Favored equipment socketed with the Starstone adds the results of one additional special die while you use it. |

It may end whenever it turns, and the maximum Seed quality is 2/rank.<br><br>- **SOW:** Gain specialization in setup of new projects, and enter Sow. This enchants the project with a Seed, a 0MP cluster and Q1 material component for actions used to complete or resolve the project.<br>- **WAX:** Gain specialization in cumulation of progress. This, healing, or a wheel turn within 10m turns any Wheels of Harvest within view into Wax, and growing a Seed +1Q. Mana gleaned while the Wheel of Harvest is active may be added to an existing mana cluster within touch range.<br>- **REAP:** Gain specialization in finality, entering Reap as an action, granting +1 Harvest success, +1HP, +1MP, +1 Prep, or add +1 Smite damage on one attack, per 2MP or 2 Seed quality spent, and turns the wheel.<br>- **WANE:** Gain specialization in decline, entering Wane with crescendo concentration on a target. Creatures suffer Curse 1 on extended, maintained, and save rolls, and the threshold for durability before objects wither, breaks, or corrodes is reduced by 1, cumulatively for each round that 1HP, 1MP or 1 Seed quality is consumed. Failure to crescendo causes the effect to persist until the resource is depleted. Turn the wheel once the effect concludes. |

Once found, investigation success totalling the sought power of the leyline, rolled once per hour, allows the rolling of a d6 for one of the six cardinal directions; on a 6, the leyline extends for 5km in that direction in a Wandering Path toward a nexus of one greater power level. From there, investigation may be performed again, potentially discovering a network of interlaced leylines, reaching a maximum power level up to your rank.<br><br>Leylines may be used as a ritual site once per day, providing 1MP per hour of ritual, up to the leyline's health, as a percentage of the leyline's maximum power.

Each skill success, 1MP, or 2SP spent may either extend awareness out 1km, or, having detected something, allows you to guess one narrower direction, in an effort to determine its location.

Making an Intelligence, Will, or Control check for 1MP each hour, up to a number of hours determined by your Poise, successes are accumulated from multiple rituals toward gaining insight, learning the location, and reading the history of people, places, plants and animals, objects, or events. Each Find success contributes to either the uniqueness of the target, 0-10, or the range of time: 1-5 per year, then 1-5 per decade, then a century at a time.

If used on an organic creature, resisted by a contested Endurance save, inflict an IMM 3 Exhaustion ailment of a value equal to the difference in the save, as their blood and airways clot and solidify.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| RANK 4 | SCULPT FLESH             | _Grasp scalpel; slice, the landscape surveyed. Raise curtain; pin, helix unravelled. Shift muscle; wonder, and possibility._<br><br>By contributing successes to an extended Dexterity.Medicine/Crafting check, made at most once per day over the course of a number of hours equal to dice rolled, your efforts to heal and tend to creatures who suffer deformity, of both genetic and injury in origin, may slowly regenerate the subject’s body. The process is complete when successes total triple the creature’s racial health value, and costs 1 mana and 1 Spirit each roll. You may alternatively use mana clusters and an extended check to reshape one aspect of the target’s appearance, including height, weight, build, the sound of their voice, and the color of their hair and eyes. This effect lasts for 24 hours, but can be made permanent instead, for a total amount of mana equal to the creature’s size, and double their racial health attribute in successes.<br><br>At rank 5, this process may convey specialization in a single action that your physical form could otherwise affect.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|        | ORGAN DONOR              | _As life begets life, so too are the gears interchangeable._<br><br>You may make a single Dexterity.Medicine/Husbandry skill check in an effort to harvest one organ of choice from a creature, living or recently dead. If no successes are accumulated, the organ is damaged. An undamaged organ, transplanted quickly enough, may be surgically installed into another creature’s body; this may require the surgical removal of the target organ. This may do anything from rid the creature of an incurable disease, to grant the creature powers and abilities held by the transplanted organ. For example, eyes may be made to see in the dark, or from far away, gills may allow the lungs to breathe water, or skin grafts may grant a resistance to fire. At the host’s discretion, this may be reflected in the taking of a relevant Trait. At rank 5, granting of physical properties between you and another creature may, over an extended ritual generating 10 successes or more, at one roll per hour, permanently transfer one health capacity, mana capacity, resistance, or weakness from one target to the other, or 20 successes per attribute point. Only one feature may be transferred per paired target, and only with a successful Will vs Poise contest if the target is unwilling. |
