## ENEMY CONVERSION:
-To begin with, let's measure enemies in terms of how much XP they give, rather than the number of party members of comparable strength it takes to defeat 8 groups of them once a day. It forms a more honest baseline and gives the players insight into how many they should bring to take care of this enemy, especially bosses.
-Size and Type are fairly straightforward. The sake of the narrative boils many creature types down into a generic spread, rather than work to keep track of individual advantages and vulnerabilities. If there were to be any standouts or unique statblocks, they would need to be introduced as Characters.
! - Given that these are likely all the same Size/Type baseline, deviations in Health should indicate a willingness to fight, not actual robustness. Leaders and other champions can take on this role, as they represent a deviation from a standard norm.
! - Especially as their stats and skills deviate, it might be worth considering representing these statblocks as different races, which would help keep them distinct from the crowd, without actually defining them as a Character.
-Health should maybe fluctuate around a "5 damage per hit" baseline, rounded to the nearest 5. Bandits can be struck twice before losing their will to fight, whereas the Spy and Thug can be struck as much as four times by basic weapons or twice by large weapons. Guards are an interesting puzzle, because they're as weak-willed as Bandits, but with better armor. Perhaps the conversion should simply combine the two:
-Bandit (11+12=23), Guard (27), Spy (39), Thug (43)
-Alternatively, if health is standardized across the board as 5, the remainder becomes a measurement of Conviction/Steadfast; Bandits are Low (bonus if desperate), Thugs are High (confident and violent), Spy is High (trained against torture), and the Guards would have to be determined by whether they were random mercenaries or expert bodyguards
-On that expert assessment... maybe Steadfast can be tied to proficiency in some way. Or Conviction.
-If classes/NPCs can be evaluated as rank 1-5 the same way their proficiency can, it might produce a relevant baseline for both NPCs and character builds. For instance, if the Spy is only Rank 3, an experienced professional but not an expert, that crunches them down between a spy who has only passing activity of being an informant, and a powerful assassin or saboteur or mastermind.
