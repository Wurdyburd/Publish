# GETTING STARTED

A quick-start list of instructions and references for getting into the game as soon as possible.
- Skill Checks and Exertion
- Hastened Time and Turn Order
- Scenario Resolution
### SKILL CHECKS AND EXERTION
- When determining the consequences of an action or reaction, a minimum of three die are rolled, and the second-highest value stands.
- Each die represents one of Attribute, Proficiency, Equipment, Magic, or Belief. Measured on a scale of 0-5, they represent d2, d4, d6, d8, d10, and d12, beginning with effortless, then requiring training or a specialized approach, and ending in fame or infamy.
- Thresholds of multiples of 2 describe the base difficulty of an action (2, 4, 6, etc), while every 2 points in excess of that difficulty represents an additional level of success. Every die result of a 1 produces complications, which cancel out levels of success.
- Since die results favor failure, you may *exert*, adding one to the final die, or rerolling the die and taking the new result, while noting a point of damage to that resource. Each two points of damage causes that resource to be rolled as a smaller die. (ex. A rank3, d8 resource is instead rolled as a d6, and later, as a d4, then a d2.)
- You may rest briefly to transfer reserve points to damaged resources, and the quality of your sleep determines how many reserve points you replenish.
- Multiple allies who share the same resource may halve the difficulty of an action, before combining their successes to try to exceed the initial threshold.
- Be careful not to overtax yourself too often or too quickly, but don't let hard work keep you from pursuing your goals!
