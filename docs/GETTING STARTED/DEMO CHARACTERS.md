This is a template to explain the components of a character sheet.

## EXAMPLE
- 15 starting points for Proficiency.
- Each level costs an amount equal to the new level. (Proficiency 2>3 costs 3)
- Every (3/2/1/0/0) level purchased increases the cost of others of the same level by +1.

### EXPLANATION
Attributes range from 0-5, based on instinctual capability.
- 0 - d2 - BANE. This ability is so weak, it's downright dangerous. 
- 1 - d4 - WEAK. The domain of the very young or infirm.
- 2 - d6 - BASIC. Average of what you can expect from your typical human being.
- 3 - d8 - STRONG. Either through training or talent, you succeed well and often.
- 4 - d10 - POWERFUL. Capable enough to have warranted some renown.
- 5 - d12 - FAME. So powerful, that tales and rumors spread of your deeds or misdeeds.
Difficulty and success levels are described in multiples of 2. Each die resulting in a 1 deducts 2 from the final score/adds 2 to the challenge level.
- 2 - Effortless. May cause issues for children, the elderly, or the ill.
- 4 - Standard. Consequences are relatively minor for failure, requiring but a nudge to succeed.
- 6 - Taxing. Requires effort, a helping hand, or a good deal of competency.
- 8 - Demanding. Requires great talent, professional skill, and appropriate tools.
- 10 - Expert. Requires high skill, prolonged effort, and often high-quality tools.
- Every 2 points in excess of 10 denotes another span of time an expert might have to work before a project is completed, or that a truly monstrous entity might be able to accomplish by themselves.
