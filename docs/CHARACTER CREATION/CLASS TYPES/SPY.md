An informant, a saboteur, or an assassin, spies prioritize investigation and information gathering that can expose vulnerabilities, as well as moving with speed, stealth, subtlety, and precision to make any step into the threatening outside world count. A powerful part of any toolbox, spies are an appendage of much larger social orders, for even when they gather information alone, they end up selling to whoever they feel will pay the most for their services, potentially immediately, but more often in the long run, as spies have the patience and foresight to assess all the moving parts of society.

ROLE:
- DUNGEONEER: While not explicitly delving into dungeons, many spies could use their skills in searching for hidden panels and disarming traps to assist in a dungeon.
- SAGE: Often, a spy will end up learning quite a bit about how others work and what they know, in order to better assess their value, or the threat they possess, but they still demonstrate a similar expertise in research and investigation.
- WARRIOR: Some spies train with weapons so as to defend themselves in the event of their discovery or capture, though they will use the first opportunity to leave the battlefield.
- CRAFTER: Being able to forge or replicate documents, concoct poisons and serums, and build and maintain your own equipment with secret compartments and folding hinges is useful.
- SNEAK: A spy will often attempt to work unseen, or disguise their intentions long enough to stab someone in the back.
- SOCIALITE: Sometimes a target may just tell you what you want to know, so long as they can be convinced, or betray their true thoughts through their actions.

RANK: Anyone may attempt to sell sensitive or strategic information that they happened to overhear, but spies will often make an entire career of the art, and many end up becoming specialists of some kind. Spies therefore range anywhere from rank 1 to rank 5, or even beyond. The higher the rank, the less likely it is for a spy to do their own dirty work.

CROSSCLASS: Spies of any real caliber often practice to be such from a young age, surrounded by trainers and other students, though more minor spies can come from a CRIMINAL or VIOLENCE background of thieving and banditry, or even NOBILITY. They never really put away this period of their life, however, their attitude and mindset forcing them to remain suspicious henceforth, or having to mask their true thoughts to be welcomed into a more mundane lifestyle.

PROFICIENCY:
- A spy can have just about any proficiency, depending on the field of study that they want to investigate or infiltrate.
- Weapons prioritizing speed and concealment, such as daggers, needles, or light crossbows.
- Civilization and Taste allows spies to confidently mix with any stratum of society.
- Strategy and Entrapment both helps a spy lure targets into action and evade traps themselves.
- Deception, Persuasion, and Seduction, for manipulating the unaware.
- Stealth and Presence, for in all things, a spy is best when undetected.
- Crafts, Manipulation and Somatosense, to search for hidden compartments and pick locks.

BELIEFS:
- LOYALTY (+): To carry out the duties of those they swear fealty to.
- LAW (+): To enforce upholding the law, you must bend or break it.
- INDEPENDANCE: Opt to work alone, out of disgust or paranoia.
- SHRINK: People are a puzzle you can figure out, given time and clues.
- MANIPULATOR: Drive others to your ends, to fulfill a goal or out of spite.
- COMPROMISE: The ends justify the means.
- DESPERATION: Survival at any cost.
- STOIC: Calm in the face of adversity.
- MASKING: Never let them see the real you.
- SUPERIORITY: You'd be stopped if anyone could stop you.
- SPECIALIST: Doing a job right requires the right resources.
