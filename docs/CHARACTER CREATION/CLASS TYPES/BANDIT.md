Cutthroats, vagabonds, lowlifes and highwaymen, bandits are driven to the outskirts of society through evasion of the law. Often roaming in packs and gangs, they'll prey upon the weak, exploiting their vulnerability, or strike at the wealthy, looking for a big payout. They use the threat of violence and browbeating to encourage victims to give up their belongings, though the especially hardened may see murder as the quickest and easiest option to get what they want. Bandits primary motivation for stealing is survival, and may or may not sell what they steal, especially if it cannot help keep them alive, but can be sold or traded for supplies that can.

ROLE: 
- EXPLORER or DUNGEONEER: Bandits fled to the wilderness may shore up in caves and ruins, or go delving looking for treasures that they can haul back and sell.
- WARRIOR: Bandits who rely on violence or the threat of it will likely train in combat techniques.
- COMMANDER: Bandits who work together will likely have some teamwork elements and team designations.
- SNEAK: If stealth and subterfuge is a major part of a bandit's strategy, they may use this role.

RANK: A lack of marketable skill and trapped between the law and harsh survival mean most bandits are of rank 1-3.

-CROSSCLASS: Banditry comes about through desperation and misfortune, perpetuated by lack of forgiveness and pursuit by the law. A bandit may return to a life of normalcy if they can ply some skills in a civilized trade, but bandits who don't die or get arrested first may lean toward paths that favor CRIMINALS and VIOLENCE, such as Thieves, Bodyguards, Mercenaries, or Assassins.
