Danger and threats abound in the lands of ruin, and guards stay the hand of those who mean harm: to steal, to kill, and to destroy. Guards typically have a Ward, as a specific target and motivation for keeping it intact, be it as a bodyguard, a town guard, a jailer, or a nightwatch, for coin or loyalty. They may go on patrol, skirting a perimeter to catch wind of possible threats, widening the radius of safety their Ward enjoys and giving guards a wider margin to repel incoming threats, but will usually only do so if they have the numbers to provide adequate coverage.

ROLE:
- WARRIOR: Almost exclusively, a guard is present to discourage behavior with violence as a deterrent. 

RANK: Anyone may become a guard, albeit potentially a poor one, but high-level expert guards take their role seriously. Most will be rank 2-3, and rarely 4.

CROSSCLASS: A guard is a fairly generic line of work, namely for the young and fit. A character may both become a guard and leave guard work as a mercenary using VIOLENCE, though an older guard may take on a more administrative role in enforcement of LAW and ORDER.

PROFICIENCY:
- Simple weapons and equipment used to protect, prevent advancement, pacify, and work with a regiment, such as swords, shields, spears, and maces. Rarely, bows.
- Armor of various weight, and shields of medium size or larger.
- Civilization, Commanding, and Empathy, for managing civilians
- Entrapment and Insight, for anticipating subversive threats
- Perception and Investigation, for detecting incoming threats ahead of time

BELIEFS:
- PROTECTION (+): To protect those who cannot protect themselves.
- LOYALTY (+): To carry out the duties of those they swear fealty to.
- LAW (+): That carrying out the law is important, no matter the outcome.
- SUPERIORITY or RESPECT (-): To place yourself above and force your will on others.

SPECIAL:
- WARD: Choose a target, or philosophy that covers several targets, to extend your services to.
