Thugs, or delinquents, gangsters, or goons, describe a kind of inner-city lowlife who stands firm against societal norms oft perpetuated by civilization. Taking either a lone wolf attitude or roving in street gangs, they'll strongarm others into submission and clash with other rival gangs in order to gather the respect and recognition they crave, to rise above their peers in a kind of streetwise hierarchy, or sell their strength to more organized crime lords and kingpins, doing the heavy lifting and knocking heads when told to.

ROLE:
- WARRIOR: Their flagrant disrespect for the world and each other often leads to tussles in the streets and alleys, which can escalate into full-blown gang wars and battles.

RANK: Thugs range from the low end of misbegotten and rebellious youth, up to adult gangsters and into the reaches of professional bruisers, but their talents rarely extend beyond that, and despite their raging against their cage, remain fully under the boot of more organized folk. Because of this, thugs are usually between rank 1 and 3.

CROSSCLASS: It's common enough for a rebellious youth with not enough skill and too much time to wind up on the streets antagonizing honest folk, but it's much rarer for them to develop any skills applicable in other fields. They both come from and wind up in CRIMINAL and VIOLENCE positions, though they may later put their strength toward honest work in places such as shipyards or manufactories.

PROFICENCY:
- Simple or improvised weapons, including daggers and shivs, maces and sticks
- Civilization, to remain streetwise
- Language, as they may actually meet enough people to learn some
- Athletics and Hauling, to do the heavy lifting and dirty work
- Intimidation and Presence, to browbeat and pressure others into submission

BELIEFS:
- LAW: Undermining civil order and the role of society.
- LOYALTY: Intense devotion to those under the same banner.
- RIVALRY: Ferocious hatred of those whose banner rejects or competes with their own.
- ENVY and PRIDE: Wanting recognition, power, and respect.
- COMPASSION: Those who appear pure and admirable earn respect, support, and protection.
- QUICKDRAW: Violence and the threat of it is a ready solution for anything you don't like.
- ANARCHY: Civilized hierarchies are to be spurned and spat on.
- COMMUNITY: An extension of the tribe and banner, everyone lifts each other up, as equals.
- TERRITORIAL: Everyone's got their corner, and yours is here.
