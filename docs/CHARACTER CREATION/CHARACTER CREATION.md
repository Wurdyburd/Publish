## FIRST, WHAT IS A CHARACTER?

A creature is any entity that can perform actions that may affect the decisions of another entity, while a character is an individual entity identified to alters or propels the narrative of a story. This may either be immediate, or after even thousands of years. Guards, wolves, and forest spirits are examples of creatures; Julius Caesar, Balto the dog, and the god Thor are examples of characters.

In game terms, a character is defined as a collection of variables that are kept track of and affect the creature's ability to enact and respond to change:
- [[CREATURE TYPE]]: The genus of the creature sets a baseline for the creature's abilities, as an average that can be recognized at a distance apart from other creature types. May include subspecies with consistent traits.
- [[ATTRIBUTE]]: Broad categorizations of ability, determined by Creature Type and subspecies, but which may deviate from individual to individual. Split into Physical, Mental, and Spiritual categories, with a Power, Precision, and Persistence attribute each. Acts as a Resource, and the source of Derived Resources.
- [[PROFICIENCY]]: A narrower categorization of aptitude used to perform specific types of tasks at a higher level and more consistency, which may require prior knowledge or training. Acts as a Resource, and can Specialized in.
- [[BELIEF]]: A muddy collage of thoughtless impulses and satisfying affirmations. Can come from the creature's Culture and Traditions, but can even stem from basic survival instincts.
- [[CLASS]]: An assortment of certain skills, proficiencies, equipment, or attribute increases held by a 
- [[SKILL]]: A specialized technique with a consistent application. Grouped into a hierarchal collections based on theme, source, and application. Contains one Talent per Class selection.

In the game of Road and Ruin, a character refers to any entity that can perform actions and affect the world or other creatures.
They can include heroes, villains, animals and monsters, gods, or simply people trying to get by in an unforgiving world.

Characters are defined by a combination of physical, mental, and social traits, skills, past experiences, beliefs, and belongings, such as keepsakes, equipment, or property, and may be able to cast spells.

Characters are usually split into two major denominations:
- Player Characters, or PCs for short (also Main Characters, or MCs). These are characters used to represent the players at the table, and are the primary driving force of the narrative.
- Non-Player Characters, or NPCs, are other characters or creatures that populate the game's world, acting as allies or enemies, services or obstacles, or just making the world feel lived-in. Their actions are largely decided by the active storyteller or Host at the time, whoever it may be.
## CHARACTER TRAITS

Each creature in the world can be defined by multiple factors. How they approach a situation, and how successfully they navigate it, can be influenced by their physical capabilities, experience and expertise, and what shape they're in.

### BROADLY:
- [[CREATURE TYPE]]
- SUBTYPE or [[RACE]]
- PRIMARY [[ATTRIBUTE]]S
- [[SECONDARY]] ATTRIBUTES: [[HEALTH]], [[MANA CAPACITY]], and [[SPIRIT POINTS]]
- [[PROFICIENCY]] and [[SPECIALIZATION]]
- CLASS, BUILD POINTS, and POWER LEVEL
- DEEDS and XP
- [[TAG]] [[RANK]]S and [[SKILL]]S
- [[EQUIPMENT]]
- [[BELIEF]]S, FACTION, RELIGION, and ALLEGIANCES

#### CREATURE TYPES and SUBTYPES
'Creature' broadly refers to any being that has any kind of autonomy, and the ability to assign itself tasks to perform.

- [[TRIBE]]s are higher intellect species who form communities, observe rites and traditions, and develop culture. They speak [[LANGUAGE]], build and trade, and develop a morality defined by [[LAW]] and [[TENET]]. Enough separation can lead to development of a [[RACE]], with a genetic heritage and different cultural practices.
- [[BEAST]]s are of middling to low intelligence, and though they may form communities and recognize patterns, they don't necessarily understand speech, and often act purely out of instinct. They may be defined as an [[ANIMAL]], or a [[MONSTER]].
- [[SPIRIT]]s are often intangible, metaphysical entities, a concept made manifest, and so may be quite alien. [[ELEMENTAL]]s, [[FAE]], [[YOKAI]], [[GHOST]]s, [[TOTEM]]s, [[DEMON]]s, and even [[GOD]]s are defined by their [[ESSENCE]] and [[ASPECT]], symbolized by [[ICON]]s, and may follow [[LAW]]s and [[TENET]]s.
- [[CONSTRUCT]]s are defined purely by their [[LAW]] and [[TENET]], which is generally assigned to them by another, often their creator. They lack spiritual or mental energy, as purely physical creatures, aside from a power source.

Tribes are the most common type of playable character, but beasts, spirits, and constructs are also playable, though all with limitations. Feel free to control whatever sort of character you feel is best representative of your wants from the game experience, or best suit the story you want told, but keep in mind you may experience some difficulties, and that the rest of the table may have concerns or complaints.
