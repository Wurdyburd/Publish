May include subspecies with consistent traits. - ATTRIBUTE: Broad categorizations of ability, determined by Creature Type and subspecies, but which may deviate from individual to individual.

A powerful part of any toolbox, spies are an appendage of much larger social orders, for even when they gather information alone, they end up selling to whoever they feel will pay the most for their services, potentially immediately, but more often in the long run, as spies have the patience and foresight to assess all the moving parts of society.</p> <p>ROLE: - DUNGEONEER: While not explicitly delving into dungeons, many spies could use their skills in searching for hidden panels and disarming traps to assist in a dungeon. - SAGE: Often, a spy will end up learning quite a bit about how others work and what they know, in order to better assess their value, or the threat they possess, but they still demonstrate a similar expertise in research and investigation. - WARRIOR: Some spies train with weapons so as to defend themselves in the event of their discovery or capture, though they will use the first opportunity to leave the battlefield. - CRAFTER: Being able to forge or replicate documents, concoct poisons and serums, and build and maintain your own equipment with secret compartments and folding hinges is useful. - SNEAK: A spy will often attempt to work unseen, or disguise their intentions long enough to stab someone in the back. - SOCIALITE: Sometimes a target may just tell you what you want to know, so long as they can be convinced, or betray their true thoughts through their actions.</p> <p>RANK: Anyone may attempt to sell sensitive or strategic information that they happened to overhear, but spies will often make an entire career of the art, and many end up becoming specialists of some kind.

It forms a more honest baseline and gives the players insight into how many they should bring to take care of this enemy, especially bosses. -Size and Type are fairly straightforward. The sake of the narrative boils many creature types down into a generic spread, rather than work to keep track of individual advantages and vulnerabilities. If there were to be any standouts or unique statblocks, they would need to be introduced as Characters. ! - Given that these are likely all the same Size/Type baseline, deviations in Health should indicate a willingness to fight, not actual robustness. Leaders and other champions can take on this role, as they represent a deviation from a standard norm. ! - Especially as their stats and skills deviate, it might be worth considering representing these statblocks as different races, which would help keep them distinct from the crowd, without actually defining them as a Character. -Health should maybe fluctuate around a \"5 damage per hit\" baseline, rounded to the nearest 5. Bandits can be struck twice before losing their will to fight, whereas the Spy and Thug can be struck as much as four times by basic weapons or twice by large weapons. Guards are an interesting puzzle, because they're as weak-willed as Bandits, but with better armor. Perhaps the conversion should simply combine the two: -Bandit (11+12=23), Guard (27), Spy (39), Thug (43) -Alternatively, if health is standardized across the board as 5, the remainder becomes a measurement of Conviction/Steadfast; Bandits are Low (bonus if desperate), Thugs are High (confident and violent), Spy is High (trained against torture), and the Guards would have to be determined by whether they were random mercenaries or expert bodyguards -On that expert assessment... maybe Steadfast can be tied to proficiency in some way. Or Conviction. -If classes/NPCs can be evaluated as rank 1-5 the same way their proficiency can, it might produce a relevant baseline for both NPCs and character builds. For instance, if the Spy is only Rank 3, an experienced professional but not an expert, that crunches them down between a spy who has only passing activity of being an informant, and a powerful assassin or saboteur or mastermind."},{"location":"GETTING%20STARTED/GETTING%20STARTED/","title":"GETTING STARTED","text":"<p>A quick-start list of instructions and references for getting into the game as soon as possible. - Skill Checks and Exertion - Hastened Time and Turn Order - Scenario Resolution</p>"},{"location":"GETTING%20STARTED/GETTING%20STARTED/#skill-checks-and-exertion","title":"SKILL CHECKS AND EXERTION","text":"<ul> <li>When determining the consequences of an action or reaction, a minimum of three die are rolled, and the second-highest value stands.</li> <li>Each die represents one of Attribute, Proficiency, Equipment, Magic, or Belief.

You gain either increased command of creatures who make use of that trait, increased skill at manifesting that trait, or increased skill at harvesting and crafting with items of that trait.</li> <li>RTM: ETCH FLESH: You gain the ability to treat organic materials, and align their magical energies to form a lattice, not unlike an artifact. This allows you to not only more easily enchant a target, but to cause that enchantment to persist quasi-permanently.</li> <li>STAMPEDE: You spook or motivate all animals within a small grouping to leave the area, gaining the Stampede intention. Linking to, favoring, or travelling as part of the group allows for you to control their direction, speed, and stopping location.</li> <li>GROUPTHINK/MOB MENTALITY: Thoughts gain Contagion. Creatures within proximity to the target gain the same intention. Creatures who do not share belief in the intention are rendered confused. At a higher level and for a mana stone cluster, you may temporarily alter the mob's beliefs as well.</li> <li>GROWING PAINS: Creatures and objects may be created in or begin growing in a space half as large as their final size. The creature's Strength, Durability, and Size in excess of the space it's growing deals one durability damage to the holding space, and one durability and health damage to the creature or object.</li> <li>ARCANE ARSENAL: AMPLIFY FORCE. Spend energy to amplify the effects of force in the moment of contact.</li> <li>LIGHTNING ROD: Either you or a target you are linked to and concentrate on becomes an anchor point </li> <li>NIMBLE FINGERS: Ready-grab inventory, more of your inventory can be sorted as quick-access</li> <li>RESTORATION/GREATER: Reverse the impact of negative effects, such as soiling, damage, disease, poisons, and decay. Greater Restoration multiplies the effects, and at upper levels, adds 'curses' and 'aging' to the list of effects. This spell restores a target to it's highest-quality natural state, but cannot renew or replicate enchantments or blessings or exterior effects such as binding, and while it may repair a body, it cannot cause a dead target to become alive again.</li> <li> <p>KEEPERS: Adherents of Light may enchant light sources to never go out, or create lights while they concentrate, as a miracle. Adherents of the Sun may emulate sunlight, but only from a single-direction or single-point light source at a time. Adherents of the Stars may emulate as many light sources as they wish, but only to Glow level. Adherents of the Dark retain their ability to see in darkness. Adherents of the Flame, or other elements, may cause an elemental state to persist, for as long as it's state (burning, freezing, windy, etc) doesn't cause exterior changes.</p> </li> <li> <p>EXPLORATION - INTERIORS. Types of ROOMS are connected via PASSAGES. The layout of the complex is determined by Origin, and Purpose, and each Interior may have different numbers and types of entry points, or adjoin or combine with other types of interiors, from geological, erosion, volcanic, crystalline, prospecting, travel, occupation, cadaverous, or magical means, but always through either excavation of soft or removable material, like stone and soft earth, ice, wood, or other organic masses, or the construction of free-standing or leaning architecture.</p> <ul> <li>GEOLOGICAL - \"Caves of force\", PASSAGEs and ROOMs are formed from the shifting of the earth, cracking fissures and grinding of stone or ice, or the collapse of heavier material as the earth beneath it is removed and forming gaps. May range from the smallest of fractures and crawlspaces, to enormous craggy excavations. Not typically friendly to traversal, and potentially unstable. Those with flowing water or sufficient air flow may also house various species of plants, birds, and animals, which may prove exotic based on remoteness from the surface.</li> <li>EROSION - PASSAGEs form from the dissolving of mineral material, often through pre-existing cracks, as it carries the material away. Underground rivers are large, constant flows like this, but may not be large enough to traverse, or have breathable air, and may simply travel straight down into underground aquafers. ROOMs are developed from the long-term erosion of large amounts of material, either from downward or upward seepage, the accumulation of moisture from the outside on the cool walls, or sideways lapping of a large body of water, and may have opened a drainage passage leaving the space mostly empty, or continue to be flooded. Water may be toxic and hazardous, and deceptively deep or swift.</li> <li>VOLCANIC - Formed from the flow of high-pressure molten rock in the thousands of degrees, as it forms PASSAGEs through paths of least resistance, ROOMs are created by the pooling of magma, before the pressure lessens elsewhere enough for the flow to move in that direction. On the surface, exposed magma may cool, forming a roof under which magma continues to flow and carve tunnels. Vents leading to the surface are often at an angle, though vertical shafts may also occur.</li> <li>CRYSTALLINE - Though typically a mineral vein or formed inside an existing chamber, different forms of crystal, particularly magical ones, may eat away at other stone and mineral deposits, forming PASSAGEs and ROOMs made entirely from enormous crystal. Such crystals may have other latent properties, or be hazardous in some way.</li> <li>PROSPECTING - Mines are the works of intelligent creatures that aim to excavate earth, usually exclusively to extract natural ore formations to another location for processing. PASSAGES are formed by tunnels and shafts to either traverse or extract material, chimneys to exchange air with the surface, or drainage to redirect water. These may be reinforced with structures, but become unstable over time and age. ROOMs are usually only formed from hollowed-out material deposits, but can be used to store supplies afterward, as offices, or to process the material.</li> <li>TRAVEL - Removal of material to connect two exterior entry points by a tunnel. Usually to save time, effort, or resources on regularly recurring journeys, but also to avoid more dangerous outdoor paths. Often as straight as possible for these reasons, of as easy-to-excavate material as possible, and reinforced with support structures, though excavating solid rock may also occur if there are no alternatives.</li> <li>OCCUPATION - Burrows are ROOMs excavated from the earth solely for the sake of creatures to live and shelter in. Tunnels are PASSAGEs dug to connect burrows, which may separate rooms of different purposes. Both intelligent species and animals may produce these structures, though the purposes and complexities of these structures differ from creature to creature. Usually made from soft earth that can be removed with claws, rakes, or acid, such as by badgers, worms, and ants, though solid rock may also be excavated if necessary. Non-excavated structures are typically constructed as free-standing or leaning buildings, of wooden supports, excavated stone, and mortar, and may be designed for defense. </li> <li>CADAVEROUS - In rare circumstances, a structure of flesh may be discovered, cavernous spaces made from a ribcage, skull, or shell of an enormous creature, or even a space so extreme as to have tunnels made of blood vessels and chimney passages connected to working lungs. Such places are often extremely hazardous, but follow a layout logic of purpose, of processing and delivery of resources for the sake of keeping the space alive, or based on now-excavated spaces of a place that is now dead.</li> <li>MAGICAL - Different forms of chaotic energy may have an influence on the development of underground areas. Leylines, or the 'veins of venus', formed from the passage of Venusian planar energy, may result in the rapid expansion or contraction of an underground space, or warping minerals, water, and forms of life along the way, leading to terrafers that, while habitable, are among the most complex and unstable places in the world. Magic of the Labyrinth, left unchecked, will continue to unfold new spaces as per the designs of it's Architect, thus resulting in rooms and passages of a certain guided chaos. As well, pocket dimensions can be considered a form of interior space, though typically only accessible through a single portal, and the interior can resemble any variety of space, including outdoors or even non-physical.</li> </ul> </li> <li>EXPLORATION - ROOMS. Rooms are typically open yet largely-enclosed spaces, encircled by walls or structures, and often denote a STAGE all by themselves. Rooms are usually defined by a single Purpose property, though some may have more than one, which may or may not be related to it's Origin. Example room purposes include habitation, storage, conference, offices, labor stations, training, and recreation.</li> <li>EXPLORATION - PASSAGES. Passages often connect Rooms to each other or to exterior space, though in some cases a Passage may be considered a Room or Stage all by itself, and may include paths, roads, tunnels, or even bridges. Passages that connect to other passages as an INTERSECTION or change direction at an angle enough that the walls become an obstacle are considered a CORNER. Where leaving to the sides of the passage is impossible or inconvenient, closed PORTALs may act as obstacles. Example passage purposes include bypass, room connection, funneling, or regular or repeat transportation of people, creatures, materials, or substances.</li> <li>EXPLORATION - PORTALS. Portals act as entry points for rooms and passages for either creatures, air, or light and viewing, or may be placed in a WALL to grant limited or even one-way access from one side of the wall to the other, often for safety and defense or privacy. Portals large enough to be intended for convenience of travel may have a DOOR, and even a GATE designed to prevent passage without permission of entry.</li> <li>EXPLORATION - WALLS. Walls, simply, are designed to prevent or discourage passage, or to act as an obstacle against sight or projectiles. Walls may be exterior, as free-standing or leaning structures, or interior, defining the boundaries of a Room or Passage, and constitute the makeup of a CORNER. Walls that mark a boundary but are traversable, such as a line of trees or cloud of mist, still present obstacle in the form of line-of-sight or light cover. When closed, DOORs and GATEs may be considered to be a variety of Wall.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/1%20-%20Sorting%20Folder/%21WORKSHOPPING/#tags","title":"TAGS","text":"TAG KEYWORD DESCRIPTION MARTIAL WEAPONRY FORTRESS GUARD SQUAD TACTICS CELESTIAL TRAJECTORY WILDERMANN TRAPPINGS OF GIRETH HUNTMASTERY Customizing gear, pets, and techniques to pursue, capture, and slay a target.

The new belief makes full use of the power of it's parent Conviction, unless the deception is unraveled, and becomes a Doubt. - Scenarios and experiences that appeal to one or more beliefs constitutes an Urge.

Characters who become demoralized, witness an undermining or dismantling of their beliefs, or actively work against their belief in a provable way, either lose a point, or suffer a penalty to the scenario equal to the full value of their aspect, but not both at the same time. (There is no mechanical purpose to \"negative\" conviction, it's a purely psychological device to represent a demoralized character, but there's room to add a mechanic there.)</li> <li>This has multiple effects. Players are encouraged to not only build an aspect because of enormous value in specific situations, while still having the option to turn either an easily-winnable scenario or a roll that their advantage still won't let them succeed into a benefit they can carry forward for later. Players are also discouraged from undermining or violating their aspect, giving the GM AND the player rules-as-written permission to either make the difficulty harder, or spend a point to bypass for morale flexibility. A character can remain either purely good or purely bad, or have more narrative nuance with an occasional vice or an unexpected virtue. Does it have the potential to farm a low-value aspect you wouldn't want to spend points on, for the conviction to later spend on high-value benefits? Sure. Do I ultimately want the characters to succeed at the things they've invested their XP into? Absolutely.

Alliances happen when those motivations align, and bargains happen when attempting to Appeal to one character's motivation raises that motivation to the level where they're willing to overlook the ways that it'd harm their other motivation. Characters who enter an encounter, combat or otherwise, are driven by an Intent. There's something they want to achieve, or something they want to prevent. A character attempting to Appeal aims to either : - Diminish the motivation behind that creature's Intent. This is HARD, and attempts to change that creature on a fundamental level, which may be impossible, especially when motivated by baser instincts. - Separate themselves from the definitions of the motivation. This involves PERSUASION and/or DECEPTION, depending on the honesty behind the Appeal. - Distract, amplifying another of the creature's motivations until it eclipses and replaces their current Intent. - Bargain, by offering a new motivation that effectively resolves one of the creature's motivations, to the point that they're willing to accept the threat to their current Intent."},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/1%20-%20Sorting%20Folder/%21WORKSHOPPING/#concept-bringing-it-all-together","title":"CONCEPT: BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER","text":"<p>New skill check system. - When making a check, roll a die to represent your skill in a relevant Attribute and Proficiency to the task, as well as for any Equipment or Enchantments. - Three or more die must be rolled, so the third value is set as a 1 (A critical failure) unless Equipment, Enchantments, or Exertion contribute a third die. - (NOTE: Potentially, allow for two relevant proficiencies to be used, as a fill for the third die) - Values range from 1-5, which are represented by a d4/6/8/10/12. - Extreme attributes, Specialized proficiency, and Automated Equipment roll two of the same die. - Enchantments may alter the type of die, the result on a die, or add a new die. - Monstrous effects may multiply the outcome of the die roll. - The second-highest die rolled is used to determine success level: 2 - Easy, basically effortless 4 - Might require a slight nudge, better to be familiar with the subject 6 - Requires professional experience and the appropriate tools 8 - Demands specialization and high-quality tools 10 - Requires a lot of work and renowned amounts of skill 12 - Basically divine intervention CRITS - Each die of a 1 results in a complication, or critical failure. Each 2 value in excess of the target number results in a flourish, or critical success. Failures and successes negate each other. - By overexerting an attribute, skill, or equipment, it takes a point of damage, which is marked on the sheet. If damage which bring the remaining value into the range of a new die type, that die is rolled for future actions instead. For example, a value-4, or d10 contribution, that takes two points of damage is rolled as a d8. - Exerting a contribution allows either rolling an additional die of the same type, or increasing the value of the final die selected by +1. - Some features may allow overexertion to increase the die type of the additional die, or increase the final value of the die by an additional amount. - Team actions half the total challenge level, and all contributing actors adds any value in excess of the reduced threshold to a pool. If the pool exceeds the original challenge level, it succeeds.

Working together, as a Team Action, brings the threshold down to 5, and the team of three generate a 4, 5, and 6. Together, their results equal 5+(-1+0+1), or 5. Between the three of them, they would have to exert a total of 5 resources, 6 if there's pressure on the weak link to pull their weight, to get the rock to shift at all.

Each actor makes known their Intention, which includes their Objective, Target, and their Method. - OBJECTIVE may include anything from killing an opponent, to nonlethal subdual, protecting yourself or another target from harm, preventing entry, egress, or interaction, sabotage, or stealth. - TARGET describes the person, creature, object, or effect that makes up a given event. - METHOD may mean using different weapons or weapon techniques, other equipment, spells, or a variety of skill checks. - Each round of Hastened Time is broken up into three general phases: -PREEMPTIVE ACTION: These include actions taken even before the scenario, as well as actions that can be resolved instantaneously. INSIGHT, PREP, COMMAND, and FIRST STRIKE attacks occur here. -FAST ACTION: These are actions that can be taken quickly. INFLUENCE, DEFENSE, PROTECTION, REACH, RANGED, SPELL BUILDING, and the majority of basic ATTACKs occur here, in order. -SLOW ACTION: These actions are cumbersome, weighty, or have a degree of investment. SPELL RESOLUTION stages, MULTIATTACK, HEAVY BLOWS, and CRAFTING effects, in order. - Each actor has one action each round. To perform an Enhanced Action (doubling the speed or power of an action) or Split Action (performing more than one action), requires exertion. - In the event of a tie, where multiple actors would have their action resolved in the same round, all actors pool their Objective, Target, and Method votes with their allies. The activity that generates the most likeminded agreement goes first, as does any activity or resources attempting to prevent it.</p> <p>For example, if all five City Guards collectively agree to Subdue and Arrest the Adventurers, a Fast Action, and four of the five adventurers want to Escape Capture, which is also a Fast Action, while one wants to Hide from the Guards, a Slow Action, the City Guards will make their move first. They'll have to allocate their resources between the available targets, and will have a much easier time targeting the single adventurer who broke ranks than grappling with the whole of the team combined, but that'll take resources away from the rest of the team. The guards roll their attack against the adventurer's resistances, and mark any successes as Subdual damage. - ATTACK: Launches an attack against a random target in the opposing subgroup with the weapon currently in hand. Uses the weapon's standard damage die. On any result of a maximum, roll another die of one greater size. Exert to either 0) Make an attack while defending, 1) Roll at a higher size, up to the available profile, 2) Add +1 to the result, up to the available profile, or 3) Make an additional attack roll later in the initiative, at one die size lower than standard, up to a number of times allowed by the profile. - DAMAGE: \"Harm\" intention dice that land results greater than the opponent's defense generates one 'harm' success, inflicting a point of damage to the target's health and Steadfast, plus another for every multiple of that defense. (A 7 over 3 is two successes) \"Subdue\" intention dice only inflict Steadfast damage. - BATTLE STRESS: A creature who is the target of \"Harm\" intention still receives one Steadfast damage each round, even if they received no damage. - SHAKEN/BROKEN: A creature who has their Steadfast depleted becomes Shaken, and must pass a shock test every future round, with any amount of exertion necessary to succeed, in order to avoid falling back. - DEFEND: Replaces the defender's defense with any higher value rolled on using the defender's standard defense die. Exert to either 0) Attempt to block while attacking, 1) Brace with a shield or significant environmental obstacle, adding it's durability to your armor, or 2) Add +1 to the result. - FALL BACK: Moves the character to the back row of the group to prioritize.</p>"},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/1%20-%20Sorting%20Folder/%21WORKSHOPPING/#concept-tribal-types","title":"CONCEPT: TRIBAL TYPES","text":"<p>New simplification for tribes. - Creatures can have a Planar Type and/or a Creature Type, Build, and Blood.

Tunnels built beneath the ruins would be used for storage of weapons and armor, ferocious beasts, and gladiators, who would fight for the sport of cheering masses, only to return to their shackles belowground. Such days are beyond even a whisper of a breeze behind now, an old-oak forest growing up through the cracks in the foundations, scarcely a wall to be seen beyond the occasional pile of toppled rubble, yet many of the tunnels and chambers still lie beneath this soil, such as this entryway here. <p>Investigating these sort of ruins often fall to guards and travelling mercenaries, able to defend themselves in the case of attack from wild beasts or lawless folks long enough to chart the ruins, document changes, and retrieve any relics or treasures found there.</p>"},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/1%20-%20Sorting%20Folder/An%20Example%20Of%20Play/#playing-the-game","title":"PLAYING THE GAME","text":"<p>There are several play elements making up Road and Ruin, though most of them filter through the Outcome roll.

These define the basic range of Attributes, as well as offering some Specializations.</li> <li>RACE: A creature's upbringing and traditions. Can have biological implications, as well as offer equipment, Proficiencies, Specializations, and sometimes Skills.</li> <li>CLASS: The role a creature currently maintains, either as a Profession, Heroics, or a Shape that transforms them into something new. These grant Proficiency, Specializations, bonus stats, and sometimes equipment or Skills.</li> <li>SKILLS are organized by thematic TAG, and must be purchased in sequential rank using XP gained from Deeds.

A character who acts or reacts outside their Intention is rendered Distracted, negatively impacting their speed, accuracy, and skill outcome. - A character's Intention may be a course of action that requires multiple 3-second rounds; in such a case, the character is trusted to pursue that course of action until time and Outcome determine their result.</p> <ul> <li>All characters are considered to begin acting simultaneously at the start of the round.</li> <li>If the precise timing of an action has serious consequences, such as in a duel, or dodging a trap, the characters in question produce an Outcome using an Initiative modifier: the higher of Presumptive Speed (the knowledge of possibilities, INT+ CON + proficiency in the opponent's weapon) and Reactive speed (reflex to sudden change, DEX + WIT + proficiency in your own weapon), against the Action Speed (stamina per meter travelled) of the target.</li> <li>EX: A character \"fighting defensively\" has the option to block an incoming sword swing with their shield.

Usually measured in 1-5 meters, such as a single room, and often applies to duelists.     - [[CLOSE BY]] is still within travel distance, but for much larger spaces, such as an entire building, or a forest glade. Measured in 10m spans, this is often the limits of a scene or stage.     - [[FAR]] is beyond most immediate physical capabilities, measured in city blocks for distance shooting and exploration. Spans of 100m, an entire chapter might take place here.     - [[VERY FAR]] is also referred to as Horizon Distance, measured in 1-5km. This represents the extent of what a character can achieve by sight, with events measured over a day.     - [[TOO FAR]] is a tongue-in-cheek generalization for anything a character can't do, but can describe the limit of a distance a character can travel inside of a day: 10km spans, or 40km per day on foot, with events measured per week.     - [[WORLD]] distance measures in 100km spans, spanning quarters, thirds, and halves of the globe, and covers events that take place over an entire year.     - [[ELSEWHERE]] is another tongue-in-cheek measurement, simply meaning that while a target is possible, it isn't presently in effective range. - Interior spaces are defined by your relationship to them:     - [[CORNER]]S are either inside, preventing you from becoming flanked, but reducing your movement options, or outside, which permits you to hide or peer around them without exposing yourself to threats or line of sight.     - [[HALL]]S are long passages that connect rooms together. They may change direction, producing Corners, and have Doors that lead to Rooms. Their length is measured in the travel time of Distance bands, such as Short (1-5 rounds), or Long (5-10 rounds). They may have Obstacles, if used for storage, have decorations, or due to destruction.     - [[DOOR]]S are openings in walls that lead to Rooms. They may be intentional, or the result of destruction, but are large enough for a creature to pass through. They may have obstructions, and be either Open, or Closed, preventing travel and line of sight.     - [[ROOM]]S are spaces that are defined by enclosed borders. Typically interior, with Inside Corners, an outdoor space such as a garden could be considered a room. Rooms often have a singular purpose, such as for sleeping, for eating, cooking, disposal, storage, or labor of some specific variety or another.     - [[OBSTACLE]]S are objects in the environment that prevent or otherwise inhibit travel through the space. They can be decorative, such as a statue, or utility-oriented, such as a crate, or caused by destruction, such as stalagmites and large rocks.     - Positioning a character [[BEHIND]] an Outside Corner, a Closed Door, or Obstacle breaks [[LINE OF SIGHT]], and allows the creature to [[HIDE]] or benefit from [[COVER]].     - A creature may move [[ABOVE]] another creature, object, or surface, by [[CLIMB]]ING, FLIGHT, or [[JUMP]]ING. This increases the character's visibility, for better (Presence/Performance) or worse (hiding), but a creature that is (height x distance from the edge) above a creature (distance from the base) below, gains a hide bonus as though Behind or Below.     - A creature may move [[BELOW]] another creature, object, or surface, by [[BURROW]]ING underground, [[SWIM]]MING underwater, or moving beneath another creature that is larger than they are. This grants a comparative hiding bonus, as though Behind.</p>"},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/1%20-%20Sorting%20Folder/BEGINNER%27S%20GUIDE%20QUICK%20REFERENCE/#time","title":"TIME","text":"<p>Different activities tend to require different amounts of time. In Road and Ruin, many activities can be described as the amount of time, required to travel a distance, and complete an objective. - A [[ROUND]] is measured in 10 Time Pips, which take place over 3-second spans of time. These are usually isolated to a single [[STAGE]], and combine over several rounds to make a [[SCENE]]. A character may need several rounds to travel Close By, or [[EXERT]] themselves to travel the same distance in a shorter amount of time. A creature must spend at least one round to REASSESS the situation, to alter their INTENTION to pursue a new purpose, which may involve skipping ahead to that moment in time, or shifting to other Scenes or Stages in the meantime. - A [[DAY]] is measured in six [[DAY SPAN]]S: morning, noon, afternoon, and evening, and two spans of night. Many abilities, effects, or actions may only last a single Day Span, or require upkeep or additional resources to prolong the effect. - If necessary, each Day Span can be marked through the burning of four torches, if indoors, underground, or at night. - A SPELL takes an exponential amount of time to cast, per point of mana in use, but some spellcasters have mastered quickly casting certain spells by rote over a single round, or even instantaneously. - [[INITIATIVE]] is generated when the precise timing between two events have serious consequences, such as in a duel, or dodging a trap. This is applied as a modifier based on the creature's [[PRESUMPTIVE SPEED]], or knowledge of possibility (INT + CON + proficiency in the opponent's weapon), and [[REACTIVE SPEED]], or reflexes based on sudden change (DEX + WIT + proficiency in your own weapon).

If struck with 6, 7, or 8 damage, it would lose the 3SF, and take 3 points of damage to its Health.</p> <p>If a creature has no remaining Steadfast, they are considered [[SHAKEN]], and it's Intention is replaced with doing whatever necessary so as to no longer feel vulnerable, exposed, and mortal. </p> <p>If a creature spends an entire round under the eye and blade of a creature that could have struck it that round, it suffers 1SF loss as [[BATTLE STRESS]].

A random farmer found on the side of the road might be asked for directions, and never seen again, but a hero who is dragged through fire and bloodshed for years will probably have developed a few skills, and opinions.</p> <p>Organically, a character is defined by their CREATURE TYPE, which defines the primary range of ATTRIBUTES a creature can expect. Different creatures may end up having differing expectations of size, power, or skill, and so can be noted as having a power level. For balance reasons, creatures of greater base power may be given a penalty to curb their growth, or vulnerabilities, or less powerful creatures can be offered advantages to grow in power and skill faster, but narrative games may not necessarily offer these options.</p> <p>A TRIBE type creature may be further specified by a RACE, which may alter the Tribe's statistical expectations, TRADITIONS, and BELIEFS, and may be Tribe-specific. BEASTS fall into either ANIMAL or MONSTER category, and may have a subtype or subspecies, which can impact appearance, behavior, or abilities. SPIRITS are more metaphysical, defined by an ASPECT and symbolized by ICONS, that follow LAWS and enact TENETS, and can fall under [[ELEMENTAL]], [[FAE]], [[GHOST]], [[DEMON]], or even [[GOD]] categories, and CONSTRUCTS, while not being necessarily alive, still possess a kind of autonomy that allows them to impact a story.</p> <p>ATTRIBUTES are nine categories, split by physical/mental/social, and power/precision/persistence. A normal creature can expect a range of 1-5 of any, though adult humans average 2-3 in each of STRENGTH, DEXTERITY, and ENDURANCE, INTELLIGENCE, WITS, and FOCUS, WILL, CONNECTION, and POISE. Attributes impact Outcome dice rolls by granting a bonus, or penalty, based on what is expected for a task. For example, if a task that can be improved with strength only requires a infantile level of strength to succeed, having STR 2 would grant a +1, and STR 3 a +2 to the Outcome roll. Attributes can be defined as [[MONSTROUS]] and [[MINIATURE]], for a +5 or -5 super- and sub-category each. Monstrous Strength 3, for instance, is equivalent to STR 8, while a task requiring infantile strength, for Miniature Strength 5, would still suffer a -1 penalty. SECONDARY attributes, such as [[STEADFAST]] health, EXERTION capacity, MANA CAPACITY, and SPIRIT POINTS are derived from creature type, and primary attributes.</p> <p>PROFICIENCY can be earned from skills, but also from classes, and even as a racial or creature bonus. Loosely grouped by physical, mental, and social, proficiency can benefit any reasonable application; Herbalism might be used in a Dexterity check to carefully shape a hedge, but could be used with Intelligence to recall what plants make for good tea. SPECIALIZATION represents a niche use of a proficiency, such as intense surgery or performing a distraction, and grants +5 to the outcome instead, which becomes a DISCIPLINE if specialization is mandatory, such as in smithing.</p> <p>XP is earned by performing DEEDS, which are individual to a character's dreams and the duties of their role and class, and spent to purchase skills from TAGS, which are groupings of abilities by theme. Purchasing a skill from a Tag rank a character does not already possess a skill in increases the character's LEVEL, granting a BUILD POINT to spend on Class features. Build Points can also be distributed in order to help equalize different characters of different species. After each 5 levels, a character gains another CLASS selection, which may be one it already possesses. A Class is more like the lens through which skills gain meaning, gaining new Deeds, features to spend Build Points on, and granting new unique abilities or equipment, or modifying others.</p> <p>Characters begin with a minimum level of 0, and a starting Class called a [[BACKGROUND]], which describes their upbringing and culture, and what activities they may have practiced. Classes fall into three categories: [[PROFESSION]]S, which are trades and services in exchange for income, [[HEROIC]]S, which are often highly specialized and tend to inspire, and [[SHAPES]], physical transformations or alterations. Only a single Shift is allowed per character.</p> <p>EQUIPMENT can be earned or purchased for gold, or any other kind of currency. Equipment either grants specialization (and some actions may require specialized gear, as like a Discipline), or are protective, allowing a reroll of a die if a Bad result occurs. Equipment can be damaged, which causes it to perform like IMPROVISED equipment, increasing the Bad-And result threshold by 1 per status.</p> <p>Social creatures tend to use their experiences and cultural upbringing as a foundation for their BELIEFS. There may be LAWS that they follow, and TENETS that they pursue. They may humor COMPULSIONS, which are based on instinct or INTERPRETATIONS they have about the world, which may in turn stem from TRADITIONS. Social creatures also tend to develop a REPUTATION. This can result in positive advantages with a given organization or individual, or negative responses, and either of these may be based on the proven history of the character's actions, rumors spread about them, or even plain old stereotyping.</p> POWER PRECISION PERSISTENCE SECONDARY PHYSICAL STRENGTH DEXTERITY ENDURANCE EXERTION (STA) MENTAL INTELLIGENCE WITS FOCUS MANA (MP) SOCIAL WILL CONNECTION POISE SPIRIT POINTS (SP) SECONDARY [[STEADFAST]] <p>You can refer to EXAMPLES to get an idea of what different types of characters can appear like.</p>"},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/1%20-%20Sorting%20Folder/EXAMPLE%20WILDERNESS%20MONK/","title":"EXAMPLE WILDERNESS MONK","text":"<p>GENERATED ROLE: SAGE GENERATED PROFICIENCIES: MARTIAL WEAPONRY, SHIELD USE, ATHLETICS, SURVIVAL, PERFORM, SPIRITUALISM</p> <p>NAME: xxx TRIBE: HUMAN.

Favor is a power bestowed by one entity, to another, and it doesn't even have to be alive. Warriors can favor a specific sword over any other sword, clerics and warlocks vie for the favor of their patrons, and spirits bestow blessings and abilities over those they favor. Abilities might cost points of favor, which then have to be replenished by earning the being's trust, or may passively scale with the maximum amount of favor, or the amount you currently have. You may have the favor of a single animal spirit, or animals in general, or a single god, or an entire pantheon.</li> <li>REPUTATION. This also has multiple sub-types, based on what you represent to different factions. A high reputation with Elves might help grant you audience with their king, and \"Friend to Elves\" might buy you some respect with the human village on the outskirts of the forest, but it might also earn you their ire, while \"Slayer of Elves\" might grant you a bonus to intimidation checks. Like favor, you can trade in reputation, staking your reputation on a promise, that if delivered, will increase your reputation, but if failed, will cost a greater amount.</li> <li>MANA. The catch-all magical resource, most living creatures have a mana capacity based on their mental aptitude. Mana is energy that is used to facilitate alterations and transmutations of natural laws, greasing the wheels of an otherwise very scientific methodology. Mana can be condensed, forming packets that enable the delivery of more energy within a single moment than 'liquid' mana, and some spells include processes that require these, as they're too unstable to be cast slowly over time. Mana also has essence, a kind of flavoring that denotes where it came from; it can be elementally attuned, or to a living creature from where it came, and this allows for sympathetic magical practices, such as locating a son by reading the magical essence of the father, or having stronger pyromancy by using mana reaped from a blaze.</li> <li>SPIRIT POINTS. Another kind of internal energy, but one associated with the soul, and so noticeably absent from undead and machines, but abundant in spirits, which can be used to animate such creatures. SP can be spent to amplify the exertion of will on other creatures, or to bolster yourself against outside influences. However, SP can be spent in excess, causing a kind of \"spiritual hollowing\" that causes the creature to less assertive and more vulnerable to outside influence, but that can be recovered over time, but below a certain threshold, \"soulless\" confers maximum penalties, without the chance to recover naturally.</li> <li>[[COIN]]. A basic resource in any society, the value of this currency is based largely on the willingness of others to recognize it. Because of this, articles such as gems may be traded in place of coin, and different nations may mint different currency to use within their borders. Coin as a mechanic can be overly simplified for the sake of a smoother game, using just one currency the world over, or expanded out for use in games that involve trade, international relations, or currencies that mean more to secret societies.</li> <li>[[FOOD]]/[[WATER]]/MEDICINE. Basic resources, but still important nonetheless. This is usually waived in many games, but if the game takes place over long journeys, or involve securing resources for a community, there are many gameplay systems that revolve around them.</li> <li>[[MATERIALS]]. Effectively, any item that is processed, is consumed, or is used in some way to increase the value of another material. This might mean components for a ritual, ingredients for a meal, metals for smithing, or chemicals for mixing. This section requires an entire post of it's own, but Material Cost can also be waived by any playtable that doesn't feel like micromanaging such things. It does represent a non-gold, non-reputation reward for exploration though.</li> <li>[[BATTERY]]. Also called Energy, this is a storage house that grants power to electrical devices. This is more for Road and Ruin's sci-fi elements, but it's important to note that Batteries, Mana, and Spirit Points aren't ordinarily convertible between each other. A Generator might create an amount of Energy over a period of time, while different devices use different amounts of energy for different predetermined uses.</li> <li>EXERTION. Also called Stamina, this represents the physical limits a body can be pushed within spans of time. Drawing from an Exertion Pool grants the stamina needed to sprint distances farther and faster, move heavy weights, and perform combat maneuvers, but dipping below Exertion thresholds imparts Exhaustion, a penalty to reaction speed and Exertion regeneration. Performing activities a character is proficient in refunds more Exertion points once they finish the task, but never 100%, so all characters must take a seat and rest eventually.</li> </ul>","tags":["CharacterSheet","Resource"]},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/1%20-%20Sorting%20Folder/ROUNDTABLE%20DECK/","title":"ROUNDTABLE DECK","text":"<p>a</p> SET SUIT PERSON CREATURE OBJECT EVENT LOCATION TRAIT 1 -STORY HEART THE ROAD Wanderer, Guide Horse Boots Ambush Roads Endurance 1 -STORY DIAMOND THE HERO/THE VILLAIN, ARCHETYPE?

This may be/may be required to be reflected physically, as a biological enhancement. Includes scent tracking, ambush hunting, webbing, night vision, extreme sprinting, camouflage, lures, claws or teeth, scales, or gills. - PRED: DANGLE LURE - Something about you is rendered irresistibly alluring, as a biological glamour effect. Gain a method, in the form of specialization, that draws others to you, such as scents or pheromones, an attractive appearance, or even a literal glow. This may be a passive effect, or fine tuned to attract specific types of people, or even a specific individual. - PRED: MAINTAINED DENSITY - Your extra biomass and fat creates an absorption pad that helps you shrug off blows. You gain extra armor against Bashing damage equal to half your fat. SWALLOW - PRED: LOCKJAW - Your teeth and bite carry powerful force, and once you latch on, you don't let go. Gain proficiency in Natural Weapon Use, and increase the damage of your Bite attack. - PRED: SALIVATE - You produce excess saliva when hungry, granting a bonus to efforts to swallow. - PRED: UNHINGED - Your jaw can stretch, allowing for the swallowing of much thicker objects. Costs Exertion without specialization. - PRED: DISCOMBOBULEATEN - Spell, Translocation. You may attempt magic to relocate an object or creature to the confines of your stomach, bypassing your Maw capabilities. Costs +1MP as an augment for any translocation spell, Consume effect, or evokes a maw or teeth. The Distracted status on each active party in swallowing acts as an equipment bonus, increasing the chances of Great Success. - PRED: UNORTHODOX INTAKE - Choose your method of predation, from Oral Vore, Cock Vore, Anal Vore, Breast Vore, Soul Vore, Thought Vore, or Annihilation. Different methods may require different techniques and proficiencies, and several skills and traits may no longer prove relevant. STRUGGLE - PRED: ELASTICITY - Your maximum belly capacity can stretch to be much larger than it's resting state. This can allow for multiple prey, inflation and extra air, and reduction in the impact of Struggling. - PRED: ONE WAY TRIP - Your esophagus develops a check valve that makes it much more difficult to find the way back up than down. - PRED: ONE AND DONE - Material your stomach is capable of digesting may have their durability set to match a less durable material, so as to digest the entirety of it's contents simultaneously. - PRED: THUNDEROUS BELCH - When you belch air and reduce your Current Capacity, you may opt to expel all available air at once. You may choose to eject undigestables, or materials of a durability higher than a set value, of an amount equal in mass to the amount of air expelled or less. This may render those near you Distracted in surprise. - PRED: ACID AQUAFER - Your belly produces extra acid, increasing the Coverage of objects inside, as well as objects you vomit onto. - PRED: PROJECTILE VOMITING - You may voluntarily expel acid or any undigested material in your stomach to a space in front of you. This may be performed as an attack, and may vacate your Capacity for further use. - PRED: HOLLOW HUNGER - Your stomach has the capability of reducing Acid coverage, reducing Acid acidity, and maintaining an amount of breathable air at will. - PRED: OBSCURING OBESITY - Your excess fat grants a +1 equipment bonus per level to efforts to disguise its current occupant. - PRED: ADRENAL BOIL - While you have the Adrenaline effect, or any turn you spend exertion points, you may accelerate the effects of acid in your stomach from a per-hour basis, to a per-minute basis. Spending double the exertion accelerates this rate further, to a per-round basis (3 seconds). RETAIN - PRED: CLIMBING THE CHAIN/AMASS - As you consume, you work your body into ever more capable form. When you finish with prey, you may roll a Masterwork roll, contributing the difference in skill between you and your prey, and, if successful, gain a permanent +1 specialization in one element of pred activity. - PRED: WEIGHT WATCHING - Rather than commit digested prey to fat, you may instead convert their mass to exertion points. As a Pure Pred, you may retain excess points as temporary points, up to an amount equal to those gained from your last meal. New prey do not increase the amount of temporary points. - PRED: ABSORB ESSENCE - As you digest prey, you may choose to glean their mana as your own. As a Pure Pred, you may also opt to store their essence, and emulate it, potentially for spells and spell-like effects. - PRED: MASS (MIS)MANAGEMENT - Rather than exclusively fat, biomass you digest may be committed to increasing any part of the body. Unless specialized or through another fleshshaping method, each point of would-be fat may be committed in a random place, and a random amount, as a Knack. - PRED: FAST METABOLISM - Fat and muscle seems to melt off of you no matter how much you try to put and keep it on. - PRED: WITCH'S CAULDRON - Your stomach contents gain the alchemical properties of your choosing, over the course of 1hr of concentration. - PRED: HOLLOW HALLS - At any point, you may commit the contents of your stomach to an alternative, magical space associated with you. The rules for escaping this space are a magnitude higher than your normal stomach, though the exact mechanics and method for doing so likely differs. - PRED: CONSUME THOUGHT - As a gleaning technique, you may attempt to learn information that your prey knew, or was thinking about around the time of consumption. You may also glean mana or details from the thoughts of non-consumed creatures, inflicting them with the Fugue condition while they recover. - PRED: MUTATION DRIVER - Rather than fat, biomass you digest may be spent to activate Form transformations. - PRED: DOPPELHUNGAR - Having consumed and processed prey, you may attempt to reform the prey. The creature may range anywhere from being a perfect carbon copy of itself, in any state of wear, or possess any number of traits more reminiscent of you, including race, Form, essence, or up to half of your predatory skill.</p>"},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/1%20-%20Sorting%20Folder/SHIV/#prey-traits","title":"&gt;&gt;&gt; PREY TRAITS:","text":"<p>GENERAL - PREY: DIRECT DETECTION - You gain the ability to command others' awareness of you. Gain specialization in either avoiding notice, or increasing your attractiveness. SWALLOW - ? STRUGGLE - ? RETAIN - PREY: CONSUMED CARAPACE - While within a creature, you may attempt to hijack it's body, and direct it to say, and do, what you want it to. - PREY: INVERSE ABSORPTION - While within a creature, you may attempt to digest it from the inside, melding your consciousness with theirs, and assuming their identity. This action is subject to the normal rules for magnitude scaling, making conquering larger, more powerful creatures extremely difficult. Once merged, your new form may retain any measure of resemblance between you and your would-be predator. If you perform this action multiple times, each predator may only lose resemblance, though you may always maintain your own.</p>"},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/1%20-%20Sorting%20Folder/SHIV/#example","title":"EXAMPLE","text":"<p>-Scenario: Adult male human in an alleyway, Shiv up a fire escape, Far -Shiv begins her approach, stealthily. The man's currently Unaware, with only Common Perception, so we treat the situation as a baseline 0 event. If we assume practiced stealth, Shiv has a +2, and if she's trying to use the fire escape to maintain stealth on her approach, she'd need at least practiced Athletics, which she has. This gives her a +3 equipment bonus for being directly overhead instead, but doesn't eliminate the chance of Great Failure. Her final Outcome: 2-Up Success, 7-Up Great Success. -1 9 10 results a 9, or Great Success on the stealth, allowing her free movement of the area undetected so long as no new observers interfere. -Shiv, Size 3, uses her position to launch a sneak attack, Blindsiding for specialization, and use the drop for an advantage on swallowing the man, headfirst and from behind. -Initiative: Shiv takes the edge by at least an entire round, inflicting Distracted10. She moves to Swallow, which has a shift of at least +(2x 4) for the difference in Ideal Size, and causes her to exert 2 to stretch her jaw wide enough to engulf the man's shoulders. The man's Distracted Struggle suffers from a magnitude's difference in strength, and -3 Entrapment, for -8, or success on a 14-up, so even a roll of 9 9 9 isn't enough to save them, resulting in a Struggle value of -5.</p> <p>-NEED TO REDESIGN THAT</p> <p>-Shiv's Swallow maneuver thus suffers from +8-5, +1 equipment bonus from Salivate, and an initial +3 for using her weight vertically, for final value of -1 difficulty, or 5-up. She rolls 2 3 8, and chooses to Exert2 of 8 to get  the first Size of 4 in. -Round 2, the man still suffers from Distracted 5, and nets a 3 4 8, or Struggle -11. Shiv no longer has the weight advantage, but 8 -10-1 still nets a -4 difficulty, or 2-up, with two successes on a 7-up, which she narrowly gains with a roll of 4 7 10. Tipping the man over backwards, she pulls the next almost three feet of the man's torso down her gullet, leaving just the lower legs kicking past her toothy maw. -Her petite stomach, so close to her mouth, is immediately filled, distending outwards with new capacity as the man's head and arms are unceremoniously shoved in. -Round 3, the man still suffers from Distracted 2, but Shiv's speed would still outclass that. Need to work on initiative rules. The man Struggles and nets a 3 7 8, or Struggle -11, giving Shiv a 2-up/6-up, and though with only one success with a 3 5 10, slides the last of the main down her throat to join the rest.</p> <p>-Shiv's maximum elastic capacity is still far in excess of this, and so doesn't present a foothold to try to climb back out, and her One Way Trip feat imposes a -3 gear score penalty on efforts to escape. She lets loose a Thunderous Belch, eliminating the four capacity of air from her stomach, loose objects like glasses or shoes tossed down the alleyway, and her Acidic Aquifer achieves 2-Size coverage of her Acidity 9. -STILL TIME CLOCK: Acid coverage adds +2 to the attack, of a 9-damage attack, using a d10. Lack of air adds +1 cumulatively. Struggles must move one Size at a time up out of the stomach to escape. -Round 1, 3-up. Rolled a 6, inflicting 9 damage. SF8 absorbs the first blow, robbing the man of his fighting spirit, and who's only just coming out of his shock from the sneak attack. He thrashes and kicks, making an improvised unarmed kick attack, a d12 3dmg. He rolls a 5, for a 1dmg blow, improving his struggles, his Fight or Flight/Cornered offsetting the penalty of his Distracted, for 3down Entrapment, 1up Strength, and 3down from One Way Trip, and 1up damage, or an 10-up success. He nets a 2 4 7, or 6-off, his squirms making visible distensions in Shiv's belly. -Round 2, 2-up. Rolled a 9, inflicting 9 damage? Instead, deals 1 damage to health, full damage to steadfast. Clothing has some holes burned in it now, and etching damage has appeared on even metals such as the man's watch and phone. The man has 3/4hp left, but Distracted 1 again from lack of air.  He kicks again, rolling a 6-1, for a 1dmg blow, reducing Shiv to 7/9SF, and struggles again, for an 11-up success with the lower result. He nets 6 6 9, or 5-off, the cramped confines of the lizard's stomach failing to react to his efforts, while a partially-exhausted Shiv soothes her jaw and distended bloat. -Round 3, 1-up. Rolled a 6, inflicting 1dmg to health, 2/4hp, Distracted 2. The man's kick rolls 6-2, for 1dmg, or 6/9SF, and struggles for 12-up success with a 1 9 3, or Great Failure. The man's thrashing has dispersed the acids in the already-constrained belly, increasing coverage to +3. Shiv has used a moment to recover a point of exertion, and is now groaning idly, punctuated by the occasional \"oof\". -Round 4, -1 up. Rolled a 10, or 1/4hp, Distracted 3. The man's kick nets a 7-3, or 1dmg, for 5/9SF, the 13-up success resulting in a 4, or 9-off. -Round 5, -2 up. rolled another 10, bringing the man to unconsciousness with 0/4hp. Failed to deliver any miraculous recoveries in the next 5 minutes, rendering the man slain. -Several Outcome 10s in that period and no 1s would dictate variables on Shiv's side; her position in the alleyway is tucked behind some obstacles, making her difficult to spot by chance at the alley's entrance, and nobody heard the greasy goblin's earlier eructation, leaving her safe to happily gurgle her prey into a slushy stew. An hour in, Shiv rolls onto her belly, groaning, and vomit-belches scraps of clothing and buttons, a belt, and the man's remaining shoe, wallet, watch, and phone onto the pavement, drips of acid hissing into the cool night air. She curls back up around her bloated midsection, and over the next three remaining hours, her limbs become the slightest bit fatter, 1/4. -Another four hours later, Shiv would wake up, past dawn, sitting up on her now more substantial posterior, a stretch and yawn very ungraciously cascading into another rolling belch. Feeling a bit nauseous on standing up, sliding a sagging belly more than half as tall as she was, Shiv heaves, ejecting several acid-pockmarked bones and a skull, clattering into alleyway detritus for some garbage collector or homeless to find someday. With Herculean strength hoisting her grossly distended gut, Shiv would waddle, humming off down the alleyway to a back street, sloshing with every step. -Taking a roundabout way back to her dingy apartment, she'd spend the next 8 hours digesting what's left of the puddle in her paunch, her cutoff jean shorts carving deeply into an ass and hips having exploding outward several more inches in every direction, much to her dismay. She'd recovered some of her exertion overnight, but thankfully, wouldn't need to make much of an effort for the next four days at least.</p> <p>-REVISION: Acid Coverage determines damage, Acidity determines what can be damaged -Round 1, inflicts d10, 3-up (6+8special, 11/10) for 2SF/8SF, Kick for d12 (5+10special, 15/18) for 1SF/9SF, his squirms making visible distensions in Shiv's belly. -Round 2, inflicts d10+1, 2-up (9+4special, 11/10) for 4SF/8SF, Kick for d12-1D (5+1special, 6/18) for 2SF/9SF, the cramped confines of the lizard's stomach failing to react to his efforts, while a partially-exhausted Shiv soothes her jaw and distended bloat. -Round 3, d10+2, 1-up (6+3special, 8/10) for 6SF/8SF, Kick for d12-2D (1GF+3special, No Damage and Coverage +1).

Creatures suffer Curse 1 on extended, maintained, and save rolls, and the threshold for durability before objects wither, breaks, or corrodes is reduced by 1, cumulatively for each round that 1HP, 1MP or 1 Seed quality is consumed. Failure to crescendo causes the effect to persist until the resource is depleted. Turn the wheel once the effect concludes.

Once found, investigation success totalling the sought power of the leyline, rolled once per hour, allows the rolling of a d6 for one of the six cardinal directions; on a 6, the leyline extends for 5km in that direction in a Wandering Path toward a nexus of one greater power level. From there, investigation may be performed again, potentially discovering a network of interlaced leylines, reaching a maximum power level up to your rank.Leylines may be used as a ritual site once per day, providing 1MP per hour of ritual, up to the leyline's health, as a percentage of the leyline's maximum power.

The specialization may only be of either of your two highest attribute groupings, of mental, physical, or social, and inflicts Exhaustion 1 after the effect ends.At rank 4 and 5, gain an additional +1 specialization point for each provable and demonstrated form of superiority, control, or attractiveness, relative to the specialization target. RANK 4 BUILT ON BONES While in a state of constant flux, all that is Venusian is built on the scars and bones of those who came before.Like reading the rings of a tree, you may submerge your senses in the spiritual resevoir of the plane, performing a divination ritual in an effort to dredge the plane of mood and memory. Making an Intelligence, Will, or Control check for 1MP each hour, up to a number of hours determined by your Poise, successes are accumulated from multiple rituals toward gaining insight, learning the location, and reading the history of people, places, plants and animals, objects, or events. Each Find success contributes to either the uniqueness of the target, 0-10, or the range of time: 1-5 per year, then 1-5 per decade, then a century at a time. Matching essence to your target grants an additional succes per hour of ritual upon completion.Gain specialization in use of a relic of the past, or bones of another creature, in reinforcement or the creation of something new. THE WITHERING At last, in the twilight hours of life, all things slow, wither, and die, reserves reduced to ashes.Spend 1MP to enter a stance, lowering decaying and maintained concentration abilities targeting you and creatures you are linked to by 5 per concentration success as a dispel ability.As a Command for 1SP during a stance, send cold and vermin gnawing at the door, enchanting the strikes of creatures linked to you to inflict Rot, IMM3 with an accumulating value of 1, on critical hits, or on an observed target whose concentration ends, magic is dispelled, or wheel ends. Rot can also be applied to structures, each value consuming an additional concentration success, item durability level, or point of Endurance, HP, MP, SP, STA, or other resource point, when it is spent or gained.Reroll decaying concentration at the end of each round and become inflicted with another DIST3 Rot +1 each time the effect persists or Wither is applied, ending the ability once concentration cannot be maintained. You may not cast this ability while you are inflicted with Rot. RANK 5 SPLINTERED SPIRALS All things must end, even space, and even time, cast into the abyss until naught but memory survives. But long before, another branch will have taken seed, and from that, others still, so as to continue to whirl, in chaos, forever.Your energies now fully aligned to the Plane of Venus, you gain its profound sense of responsibility to grow, repair, and spread. You become Venusian, if you weren't already, in addition to your other types, and experience the compulsion to enact its Tenets and Laws if you have specialization in the task.ACTIVITY: All mana gleaned from environments and creatures are considered planar essence, and grants specialization in efforts to target or affect planar features of the same type, or in the building, crafting, or repairing gaps in a larger whole.SKILL:PASSIVE: A plane of the body and spirit, you gain a\u00a0Shape Form\u00a0to reflect which aspect of the plane you best represent.|Type|Effect||---|---||BODY|Passive: asdf.\u00a0Active: Sp.||SOUL|Passive: asdf.\u00a0Active: Sd.|- BODY:- SOUL:FILL IN THE GAPS: Building or crafting a larger whole, or repairing gaps in a larger whole, gains an advantagePLANAR ANTIBODY: [[placeholder]] ?

Creatures created using your blood link you both permanently. Spells that require touch contact may be cast through this link at any range for +1 mana. You may also choose to increase the maximum health pool of a target when you apply the blood link by 1, by sacrificing one point of your own maximum health for 1 mana, for as long as you maintain concentration, or passively for created creatures.At rank 5, you may exchange Endurance and mana costs, using 3 mana to pay 1 END, or 1 END to pay 1 mana, as a Physical technique. BEDSIDE MANNER Allies you can meaningfully interact with during a long rest regain one additional health point and one additional mana. When allies gain Well-Rested, you may spend 1 Spirit on each to grant them a Doctors Orders 3 boon, DIST 3, that they may convert to either +1 additional steadfast, or Blessing 1 on one saving throw, that each expire at the end of the day.

The process is complete when successes total triple the creature\u2019s racial health value, and costs 1 mana and 1 Spirit each roll. You may alternatively use mana clusters and an extended check to reshape one aspect of the target\u2019s appearance, including height, weight, build, the sound of their voice, and the color of their hair and eyes. This effect lasts for 24 hours, but can be made permanent instead, for a total amount of mana equal to the creature\u2019s size, and double their racial health attribute in successes.At rank 5, this process may convey specialization in a single action that your physical form could otherwise affect. ORGAN DONOR As life begets life, so too are the gears interchangeable.You may make a single Dexterity.Medicine/Husbandry skill check in an effort to harvest one organ of choice from a creature, living or recently dead. If no successes are accumulated, the organ is damaged. An undamaged organ, transplanted quickly enough, may be surgically installed into another creature\u2019s body; this may require the surgical removal of the target organ. This may do anything from rid the creature of an incurable disease, to grant the creature powers and abilities held by the transplanted organ. For example, eyes may be made to see in the dark, or from far away, gills may allow the lungs to breathe water, or skin grafts may grant a resistance to fire. At the host\u2019s discretion, this may be reflected in the taking of a relevant Trait. At rank 5, granting of physical properties between you and another creature may, over an extended ritual generating 10 successes or more, at one roll per hour, permanently transfer one health capacity, mana capacity, resistance, or weakness from one target to the other, or 20 successes per attribute point. Only one feature may be transferred per paired target, and only with a successful Will vs Poise contest if the target is unwilling.

So, what is it that Road and Ruin is exactly trying to be? A roleplaying storytelling game, is the general answer, but there's lots of those. What is this project aiming to accomplish and be? - Essentially, a more cohesive, structurally recognizable storytelling game system than what I've seen of other products. Gamifying storytelling tropes and genres such that even someone not already familiar with them should be able to play them, also means that those who ARE familiar with them can reliably add their own spin on it. - An independent system, that runs on player interpretation. Done well, this should mean that it's even playable solo, without a host-player, but at the very least, the instructional manuals for a host player should be in much better hands than in many other games. - A game that recognizes and respects risk and consequence. More than that, using the concept of Sequence to link events together, but in a way that a player will recognize when and how their choices made an impact in the long run,  - If possible, keep everything as short and direct as we can. That means shorter combats, scene-based exploration and events, chapters that can be completed inside an hour and scenes in ten minutes at a time. - The trick with the above at least is that many people, self included, like to think tactically, and make creative use of available elements, but without being prompted by an existing element, it can be hard to come up with one, and can even feel bad if coming up with something specific to take advantage of. To that end, there needs to be some kind of prompt-based element system, where a player who comes up with an idea can still trust the game to confirm, or deny, whether their 'guess' is actually true.</p>"},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/1%20-%20Sorting%20Folder/WORKSHOP/#mechanical-elements","title":"MECHANICAL ELEMENTS","text":"<p>Though the bare minimum of the game involves naught but interpreting elements and generating elements to confirm/deny interpretations, there are a few \"core mechanics\" that should be recognized by players.</p>"},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/1%20-%20Sorting%20Folder/WORKSHOP/#dice-mechanics","title":"DICE MECHANICS","text":"<ul> <li>OUTCOME: Rolling 3d10 and taking the middle, and checking against a d10-based, 50/50 spectrum, separated into intervals of BAD AND, BAD, INSIGHT/COST, GOOD, and GOOD AND, shifted up or down via situational variables.

On a clock, the party must rescue the boy, whether to finish the ritual or at least from the horrors of the Hedge. The Hedge is raw with Halloween influence on this specific day, and the group must take care not to get lost in the brambles as they encounter strange things, face nefarious characters, retrieve the child, and bring them back to safety, but other, sinister forces may be working in the background. ### 1) Lead up to the ritual, characters are given the chance to formulate their thoughts and reveal anything they may have learned. (22) - In the late evening, sun setting in a conflagration caged in twisted tree branches, slowly guttering in the horizon as it fades into a deep blue darkness, our group delves into the forest on the outskirts of a familiar city. - Faint mist flows up over verdant moss not unlike a cloud of spores, swept to the side by the shapes of other figures travelling down the sloping forest path. No one speaks, no one whispers. - Passing beneath these gnarled limbs, the trees seem to tower tall over you, giving you slight unsettling memories of the Hedge. Ivy-choked specters shift and sway, as though threatening to spring to life and snare you in their thousand-finger grasps, their knotted roots causing you to trip and stumble, and the rot of decaying life assails your nostrils. - You are called here this day by your freehold's Autumn Court, at the bidding of a travelling witch by the name of Red Wren, who claims to possess a ritual that puts a stop to the kidnapping of children in the area for an entire year and a day. When asked, she reveals the cost to be at the expense of a young child. After much deliberation, the courts defer to the reigning Autumn Court, and so, the ritual is proceeding, here, in these woods. ##### - HIKING : 0 STAMINA + ATHLETICS + EQUIPMENT. (-2 Rocks, -1 Mist). - Failure: -1 to all Social rolls here. - Dramatic Failure: 1B damage, roll again. - Exceptional Success: +1 to Stealth. #### - RESEARCH! : 0 (10-12) ##### INTELLIGENCE + ACADEMICS - Learn of Joey Duncan - Learn of an abnormal amount of child kidnappings - Learn of other cities where kidnappings end around Autumn ##### MANIPULATION + POLITICS/STREETWISE - +2 Autumn Mantle, +1 Autumn Goodwill, -2 Courtless - Learn of Court perspectives - Exceptional: Learn the following rumors, ###### RUMORS - ! - Red Wren was once Autumn Queen, but made enemies in and out of the Court of Fear. (True) - ! - Wren claims she can't remember her escape, but that's a lie, her Keeper freed her so she'd work for him. (False) - ! - King Queen Jackie Snow wasn't kidnapped by Others, he was kidnapped by Red Wren to manipulate the courts into agreeing to the Children's Contract. (True) - ! - Wren's servant henry was the first sacrifice in the Children's Contract, but it went badly. (True) ##### INTELLIGENCE + OCCULT - +2 Encyclopedic Knowledge, +1 Clarity 7+, -1 Clarity 4- - Learn the Contract occurs on Halloween, and requires a child sacrifice. - Exceptional: Learn the following rumors, ###### RUMORS - ! - The Children's Contract is an ancient now-forgotten regalia of Land And Domain. (True) - ! - The Children's Contract requires the child to be physically harmed with hedgethorns. (?) - ! - The Children's Contract requires the child to die. (False) ### 2) Red Wren zealously insists the ritual be performed. Her servant, Henry, appears a tortured prisoner, suffering stockholm syndrome and lovingly doting on his master. - Clambering over a massive fallen tree, the path broadens into a clearing approx. 20 yards across, ringed with stones, the settling mist glowing in the flickers of a circle of torches. The grass here is dead and matted, and in the center, the Autumn witch herself. Sharp red leaves unfurl from her weathered and practically translucent skin, and her auburn hair almost seems to blow from imagined wind. Her round, black, glossy eyes disguise the target of her gaze, and even looking at her too long gives you the sensation that a flock of birds flaps caws just out of the corner of your eye, though there never is if you turn to look. She moves unusually, from position to position, remaining stock still whenever not in motion, as still as the trees that ring the clearing. Near her hovers a young teenager, of African descent and in simple clothing, tending to any last-minute adjustments, and never travelling far from her orbit. - The freehold Lost who have gathered here shuffle uncomfortably. Some speak quietly to each other, the occasional glance toward the witch, some seem absolutely furious, stalking the clearing like caged animals. - Near Red Wren, lying in the grass, is a wooden door in a wooden doorframe, with an ornate metal handle. #### - CANVASING THE CROWD : 0 (WITS+EMPATHY) OR (MANIP+SOCIALIZE). (No court ties -1), (Court Goodwill 2+ courts, +1) - Dramatic: -1 Social with all gathered - Success: Gauge the court mood, Learn general opinion and mood of three characters - Exceptional: Above, but Nyx seems particularly on-edge; +1 Social with all gathered ### 3) The ritual begins, and tension is high. - Red Wren suddenly moves, spreading her leafy arms high and wide, not unlike the branches of a tree. In a booming voice that belies her appearance, she declares: \"It is now time for the Children's Contract to be written.\" - The crowd quiets, and when any antagonists refuse to do so, nearby Autumn Courtiers move to intimidate them into at least gaining some distance. Red Wren turns to her servant, who hunkers near the door, and who proceeds to knock on it three times, in a rap-tap-tap. Red Wren chants a strange rhyme, spoken, not booming, in a voice who's words are meant only for the door, the sound stolen out of the air: \"Let us out, let us in, we eat of fear, who eat of sin.\" Henry turns the knob, and the door falls open, downward and into the ground, amber light shining up through the opening, and tendrils of hedgebriar slithering past the edges. Together, Red Wren and Henry stoop down into the opening, and lift out what appears to be a wooden box. As more of the box emerges, it's length becomes apparent: a pinewood coffin, conspicuously sized for a child, wreathed in coils of dark ivy and black roses. - The coffin is propped against a nearby table, and the box is pried open, ivy ripping away, to reveal a young boy. - ##### ! - INTELLIGENCE + OCCULT + AUTUMN MANTLE: Recognize the boy, who has been appearing in dreams, as a child with a briar crown and pitch-black eyes. - The boy seems almost... tranquil. He shivers in the cold through his thin clothes, but does not blink, only stares vacantly at the scene. Henry reaches in and roughly grabs the boy's arm, pulling him, stumbling, out of the box, into the circle. Wren, reaching into her crimson cloak, produces a long, black thorn, easily a foot long, Hedge magic radiating from it like a torch. \"Let the blood of the boy and dreams of the thorns mingle, shades protect him and all like him from the fiends beyond the fence!\" She holds the thorn aloft, showing it around to the crowd in a sweeping motion, like a magician preparing to demonstrate a sleight of hand. It reminds you rather callously of a card dealer in Vegas. ##### ! - WITS + COMPOSURE vs JOHN'S (10): Sensing Cancer John - Success: You smell something... heady, like a whiff of body odor tinged with the smell of decay, like rotting meat and moldering wood. From behind you, you sense motion, a thing unseen quickly moving forward through the crowd toward the circle. - Exceptional: Above, but gain +1 to any effort to stop him. ##### ! - DEXTERITY + BRAWL (-5): Stopping Cancer John - Exceptional on Sensing (+1), Character speed of 13 or higher (+1) - Dramatic: Tackle someone wildly inappropriate, and suffer 1B. - Success: Cancer John is tackled to the ground, inflicting 1B, but not before Joey is pushed, thrown backward toward the still-open door, and tumbling through. - Exceptional: Above, but without impacting the boy. ### 4) Chaos erupts, as the freehold tries to decide what to do next. - In the darkening forest, there hangs but a moment of bated breath. Wren's otherwise unyielding facade shatters, her eyes going wide. She turns to the crowd, and stammers, \"I can't go in! I must not leave the ritual space, or the contract will fail!\" ##### - Bedlam roars through the crowd. - ! - Summer courtiers push and snarl, threatening to stream past the Autumn guards and into the circle. Enkidu laughs, a mirthless stout bark. \"What's that? You can't be taken out of the circle, or your ritual gets all fucked up? Wouldn't want that to happen!\" - ##### ! - Ruslan is a billowing cloud, rage etched upon his skeletal face, ranting about stringing up the perpetrator and gutting him like a trout, but lapsing frequently into incoherent babbling about magic and childhood. Ruslan thrusts his putrid face at his Autumn courtiers, rot on his breath and spiders in his teeth, and demands that you do something. Identify the traitor, pursue him, catch him, do anything necessary to advance the ritual. Before you can respond, he's gone again. - ##### ! - King Queen Jackie Snow steps a foot up upon a stone in a vainglorious pose. \"Quickly, Courtiers of Spring!\" she keens. \"Quickly, into the Hedge! We must retrieve the boy at once, and complete the ritual! For the sake of my nephew, and children everywhere! At once, my loyal subjects!\" The Spring Court shuffles and hesitates, and make excuses, and Jackie goes red, frothing with rage. - Nyx, of the Spring Court, slinks off to the edge of the torchlit clearing to sit upon a log, bouncing her knee in a vision of stress. She bites at her nails, snaps her fingers, chews her lip, and grinds her teeth. - From behind you, an ice-cool breath bathes the back of your neck, and icicle fingers dance across your shoulders. Morgana, the Winter Flame, seems insatiable in her advances, but something in her proposition almost implies a secret. She acts like she knows something. \"Well, THAT was a waste of time. Why don't we both duck this party? Behind a tree is lovely this time of year, quiet, out of sight. I can personally vouch for the privacy.\" - At the circle, Lady Miss Pity, accompanied by some attendants, appears a small flower against the imposing countenance of the crimson Red Wren. She seems to be attempting to negotiate with the witch, to call off this failed ritual, but venom-laced biting words from Wren sends the girl scurrying, quickly chased by her consoling entourage. - Just to the side, stands the rusted soldier, Margrave Doorman. You've heard stories of the man, how he hates the courts, and not to trust him, but he seems sincere. His voice carries no malice, only genuine concern. He seems to want to share something he knows. ##### ! - WITS + INVESTIGATION + EQUIPMENT: Identify the thief. - Three clues, with 3 successes each, representing 5 minutes of searching. - Loud crowd (-1), Distracting figures (-2), Mist (-2), Flashlight +1, Night vision +2, Common Sense +2 - Dramatic: Pointed to the wrong identity. - Success: (Page 31) ##### ! - WITS+INTIMIDATION or MANIP+PERSUASION, vs WITS+RESOLVE - Nyx: 4, Morgana: 5, Mary O'Brine: 7 - (Page 32)"},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/1%20-%20Sorting%20Folder/CHANGELING/CHANGELING/#into-the-thorns-34","title":"INTO THE THORNS (34)","text":"<p>-THE STABAPPLE TREE -THE STINKING POND (COBBLER CORMORANTS) -THE FISSURE -A MINOR TOKEN ! -TRACKING CANCER JOHN</p>"},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/1%20-%20Sorting%20Folder/CHANGELING/CHANGELING/#found-37","title":"FOUND!

One unusual similarity between the clans is a culture of maskmaking, though each clan and individual tends to have their own unique spin on things. Some will wear them on the face, or around the head as a helmet, while others pad a shoulder, or a chestplate, or even carry it as a shield. The themes appear defensive and protective, much like a guardian spirit. Typically a coming-of-age ritual, a mask is carved of wood or bone, or even stone, and hold in great reverence, treating it partially as its own entity, partially an extension of the wearer and maker. These masks are only replaced when necessary, and even the taking of a new name will often only alter the existing mask.

These three facets combine to form a society, which are defined by LAW and TENET.</p> <p>Tribes may fracture or diverge as the distance between members grows, either over physical distances, from being too large to easily travel or with an obstacle in the way that prevents such, or due to disagreements which cause members of a community to become isolated from each other. Given enough time, this can lead to variations between descendants over many generations, as their genes no longer intermingle, and changes to cultural foundations until they no longer resemble each other or their ancestors. This gives rise to a RACE, where BELIEFs, practices, or isolated mutation affects genetic heritage to such a degree that it affects descendants of the Tribe. Note, however, that creatures can still be adopted into other cultures, and while they may lack genetic markers, they can still fully be a member of their adopted race.</p>","tags":["CharacterSheet","Tribe","CreatureType"]},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/CHARACTERS/CREATURE%20TYPES%20and%20SUBTYPES/TRIBE/TRIBE/#list-of-tribes","title":"LIST OF TRIBES","text":"NAME DESCRIPTION FEATURES HUMAN PALE ELF BARBOZEEN TATZL","tags":["CharacterSheet","Tribe","CreatureType"]},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/CHARACTERS/CREATURE%20TYPES%20and%20SUBTYPES/TRIBE/RACE/AORG/","title":"AORG","text":"<p>Aorg barbozeen, commonly called 'orks' by human cultures, are a proud and confident race, and not many would dare dispute their prowess, on account of their remarkable durability, and excellence in martial combat.</p> <p>Physical traits associated with Aorg: - Standing at an imposing height of 2-2.4m (6-8ft, Size 4), and weighing as much as a small horse, their intimidating figure either belies an otherwise hospitable and good-natured personality, or fully delivers on the threatening silhouette. - Long, mane-like hair on the back of the head, of red and muddy browns, and the occasional stray blond, black, or white hair. - Thick arms and legs, with squarish fingers and toes. - Large teeth, especially the lower canines, which protrude upwards out of the bottom lip like tusks. - Squarish muzzle, with a smaller nose. - Smallish eyes for the frame of the head, but possessing a sort of intensity. - Darker, yellower green scaleskin, that wrinkles and folds with high age.</p> <p>Cultural traits shared by those within the Aorg clan: - Hair is worn long and clumped, chopped roughly into shape, or tied back using cord or braids. - Teeth or bone, which may be carved or dyed, sewn into clothing and dangling from cords. - Families live in a village constructed of tents with bent supports, stretching lengths of cloth or hide between them, decorated with dangling feather and bone chimes, and patterned with paints and simple dyes. These tents are suitable for a variety of temperatures and weather, while also being lightweight and simple enough to quickly dismantle, transport, and erect in a new location, should circumstances demand it. - Aorg that travel alone are often suspicious and aggressive toward others. Otherwise, Aorg can be found in small bounds of 4-6 for most activities. EQUIPMENT - Aorg who perform the mask ritual carry their mask with them, choosing to either wear it as a helmet, or forming it into large protective armor, such as a shoulderpad, chestplate, or medium or large shield. - Simple weapons, and throwing javelins, with the HEAVY trait. Aorg prefer weighted weapons that benefit their strength, which will often have components made of dense wood, thick iron orbs and disks, large bones, or even chunks of stone, which may be chipped or carved to a brutal edge. - Layered armor, made of multiple components and materials, scavenged from the fallen or bought or traded for cheap. It does the job, but it's often not pretty, or present a unified fighting force. PROFICIENCY - pick 4 per class selection - SIMPLE WEAPONS, such as axes or maces.

Often makes use of the HEAVY trait. - THROWN WEAPONS, such as javelins, for hunting. - CRAFTS, in order to easily improvise whatever may be needed, out of whatever's at hand. - HERBALISM, HARVEST, and SURVIVAL, to forage food and medicine from nature, and be prepared for wild animals and changes in terrain. - RITUAL, and SPIRITUALISM, if leading the rites for crafting masks and revering the ancestors. - ATHLETICS and HAULING to carry your life on your back, a travelling nomad. - INTIMIDATION and PRESENCE. Those who lead the Aorg often do so through force, be it with violence, or will. Those who are difficult to defeat or discouraging to challenge, will lead the tribe in conquest, or protect them from threats in time of peace. BELIEFS - COMPULSIONS: To act and speak without thinking, especially when roused to anger, pride, or love. - INTERPRETATIONS: Strength is required to both produce change and resist change. Those who are strong hold respect, responsibility, and the future of those who are not. Those who came before will look after those who came after, in their own way, for true strength is eternal. - TRADITIONS: Having proved yourself using your power to dominate a powerful foe or protect your kin, qualifies you for the mask-donning ceremony. The mask represents your ancestors, and donning the mask both has you join them as a guardian, and borrows their power to help protect the living. Strength must be proven to lead, and the defeat of the current leader and all competing allies required before you have the right to wield that power against your foes. - LAW: The destruction of a mask is punishable by banishment, or death. Combat is to remain honorable, and without trickery or deception. When the clan is threatened, all rise to defend the other. - TENET: Help and defend those who have not yet had the opportunity to grow and defend another. Pursue personal strength, both physical and strength of character, to become an ancestor your descendants will be proud of, and so that you may watch over them. Be of open mind, and curious.</p>","tags":["CharacterSheet","Tribe","Race","Barbozeen","Aorg"]},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/CHARACTERS/CREATURE%20TYPES%20and%20SUBTYPES/TRIBE/RACE/AORG/#typical-statblock","title":"TYPICAL STATBLOCK","text":"<p>4 2 4 | 1 2 2 | 1 2 3 || Size 4 -1 Deed Large, Ursine, Canid</p>","tags":["CharacterSheet","Tribe","Race","Barbozeen","Aorg"]},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/CHARACTERS/CREATURE%20TYPES%20and%20SUBTYPES/TRIBE/RACE/GOBBH/","title":"GOBBH","text":"<p>The Gobbh are much smaller than a typical BARBOZEEN, and their diminutive, impish appearance gave rise to the \"gobling\" or \"goblin\" moniker by non-barbozeen, and use speed, stealth, or skills to get ahead and avoid or get out of danger.</p> <p>Physical traits associated with the Gobbh: - Short, approximately Size 2, or 1-1.5m (2.5-4ft), or the size and weight of a human child. Thinner arms and legs end in larger hands and feet and head, including large pointed bat ears. - Can be extremely quick and precise, but also very intelligent and sociable. They will often use these traits to avoid direct confrontation, where they may be overpowered or threatened, and their comparably small size can work against them. - Hair of varying length on the back of the head, of darker browns to blue-oily blacks. - Smaller muzzle, with sharper teeth, and either large or small eyes, which can be effective at seeing in the dark. This can give them an impish, or even lizardlike appearance. - Much stronger skin color, of greens, browns, yellows, reds, or blues, that wrinkles and sags with age. - They may have a short, triangular, reptilian tail stub, a longer reptilian tail, or a thin tail with a tuft on the end.</p> <p>Cultural traits shared by the Gobbh clan: - Hair can be varied, but is common to tie back or cut if the length poses a risk. - Resources are distributed according to need, and large village structures, where parental responsibilities aren't strictly defined, mean that independent ownership is a foreign concept. As such, the Gobbh are not inherently covetous, providing resources and assistance when possible, but from the outside, can appear as criminals and thieves. - Village structures are often underground or in caves, where there is a significantly reduced risk of discovery and attack or invasion. A village may move locations as it's population grows or shrinks, or may split if the population grows too high. In such a case, village relocation is done quietly and discreetly, often to the extent that other nearby towns and cities are surprised by the discovery of Gobbh who have been nearby for months or even years, but the two halves of a split will often both relocate at the same time, parting as friend and family. - All Gobbh who deal with the outside world tend to develop at least one technique for risk avoidance or threat escape. This may be through speed, running into small cover or striking first, crafting devices that repel or defuse, casting spells from a safe distance, or having a network of allies and failsafes that intervene on their behalf. This makes them both incredibly desirable as specialists in many fields, while also earning ire and distrust, for being \"selfish\", or \"cowardly\". EQUIPMENT - Gobbh uphold the barbozeen tradition of masking by crafting one themselves. It is considered a respectable pastime to refine the mask, and replacing the mask with a new, better-crafted one isn't unheard of. Many Gobbh don't actually wear their mask, instead housing it in their den with any of their other belongings, which, like other belongings, is considered freely accessible to all. Personalization or representation by the mask is made that much more powerful by having it available to the world, though it's not clear why anyone would need it. This puts them at odds with other barbozeen clans, who covet their masks dearly, and the offer to trade or let them borrow a mask would baffle and infuriate other clans. - Tools and weapons, designed to go around obstacles, or through with as much speed, precision, and preparedness as possible, such as daggers, spyglasses, lockpicks, or tinkerers' tools. - Light or no armor, since the added bulk would only reduce the Gobbh's evasion, speed, or stealth. PROFICIENCY - Pick 4 per class selection - SIMPLE WEAPONS, that are either small enough to be used quickly, like daggers, or have the LONG trait, such as spears, to strike before being struck. - AMMUNITION WEAPONS, such as bows, or slings. - SHIELDS, of any size, to either deflect incoming hits with skill, or cover the entire body. - CRAFTS and MANIPULATION, to build custom equipment to size spec, and build their way out of problems. - ENTRAPMENT and STRATEGY, both to evade capture, as well as to undermine other larger and more dangerous creatures, and those who present a social obstacle. - HARVEST and HERBALISM, for MEDICINE, and poisons, and for a self-sufficient food source. - RESEARCH, RITUAL, SPIRITUALISM, and other magics. Gobbh enjoy the notion of producing effects independent of their otherwise small or weak stature. - ATHLETICS and STEALTH. Gobbh are able to run, jump, climb, and hide, if direct combat is avoided. - BINDING, HUSBANDRY, and RIDE: Gobbh may opt to tame creatures to perform their labor and fighting for them, and even ride creatures like wolves or large spiders. - DECEPTION, EMPATHY, MEDIATION, and PERSUASION are all tools a Gobbh may employ to be a savvy negotiator, brokering deals and deflecting threats. BELIEFS - COMPULSIONS: Extreme fight-flight-or-night response, to attack, run, retreat, or withdraw from attention exposed to sudden events, such as loud noise or shocking revelations, in order to process and approach the event from the ideal angle. - INTERPRETATIONS: Resources should be used for those who require them at the given moment. Confrontation can solve conflicts, and is sometimes the only or best way to do so, but preparation, patience, and evasion are also great tools to use, especially in combinations. - TRADITIONS: Gobbh will leave the nest in rotations, to seek and retrieve resources, to scout and explore, and to do combat and defend, when necessary. Each Gobbh is responsible for crafting a mask for themselves, out of any material and in any style they choose, and what the mask means is personal, including whether it's actually personal or not. - LAW: Those who do not take responsibility when it is their turn and are able, are merely a guest, to be respected and entertained, but eventually expelled, all without the trust and the family of kin. - TENET: Provide to those who are in need of what you are not yourself using. Pursue your own personal strength, and celebrate the strengths and triumphs of those who's strength you benefit from, as well as those who you grant your strengths to.</p>","tags":["CharacterSheet","Tribe","Race","Barbozeen","Gobbh"]},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/CHARACTERS/CREATURE%20TYPES%20and%20SUBTYPES/TRIBE/RACE/GOBBH/#typical-statblock","title":"TYPICAL STATBLOCK","text":"<p>1 4 1 | 2 4 2 | 1 2 1 || Size 2 Manipulation proficiency Stealth proficiency __ specialization, in a job, or hearing</p>","tags":["CharacterSheet","Tribe","Race","Barbozeen","Gobbh"]},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/CHARACTERS/CREATURE%20TYPES%20and%20SUBTYPES/TRIBE/RACE/HA-AORG/","title":"HA AORG","text":"<p>The Ha-Aorg, or \"half-ork\", have a root origin shared with the Aorg clan, though the significant differences in their appearance lead some scholars to believe that there was a schism in the community that lead similarly-minded barbozeen to leave, forming their own clan.</p> <p>Physical traits associated with the Ha-Aorg: - While still tall, Ha-Aorg average about 1.5-2m (Size 3), and tend to weigh quite heavily for their otherwise humanoid frame. - They are quicker than their Aorg cousins, both in physical speed and in temperament, faster to anger, to calm, and to humor. - Long, mane-like hair on the back of the head, of red and muddy browns, with occasional streaks of blond, black, or white hair. - Much more varied in build, the strong possess thick and heavy limbs and bodies, but there are also those who favor speed and precision, or intellect and wisdom, or social wellbeing. - A more powerful, defined jaw may or may not have larger teeth or any tusks at all. - A squarish face can have a more pronounced muzzle than what reads as human, more like a large cat, wolf, or bison. - Dark eyes are often sunk below a heavier brow. - Darker, yellower green scaleskin, that wrinkles and sags with high age.</p> <p>Cultural traits shared by those of the Ha-Aorg clan: - Hair is worn long and clumped, chopped roughly into shape, or tied  back using cord or braids. - Teeth or bone, which may be carved or dyed, sewn into clothing and dangling from cords. - Families live in a village constructed of tents with bent supports, stretching lengths of cloth or hide between them, decorated with dangling feather and bone chimes, and patterned with paints and simple dyes.

Your mask is your reputation, and should be visible and seen during success and performing your duties. - LAW: Those who work to undermine the success of the collective must be punished or destroyed.

You want to be a leader, a strategist, or a beast-tamer, for there is strength in numbers, and power in companionship.</p> <p>Commanders, like Socialites, wield the strength of others, but also require strength of themselves. Often leading by example, Commanders are found in the thick of things, confidently giving orders for things that they themselves know how to do, and may have done for many years, and will even join in to do. As such, Commander is a role that can sit at the head of any of the other roles: the head of a team of researchers, a foreman at a build site, or the captain of a squad of soldiers. But while they may share the same responsibilities, Commanders may also feel alone, the weight of their responsibilities and stress of having to trust others to do the job right making them feel isolated.</p> <p>As a Commander, handing out orders is called a COMMAND. Communicating an idea to someone or something, granting them Intention, and generating additional value if they actually follow through, it's up to you to either learn more techniques and strategies, work on teambuilding so that your people understand what you want or trust you if they don't, or are so in tune with what you want that they'll do what you want unbidden, an independent extension of your will.</p> <p>Scenarios that may require a Commander: - WARRIOR, especially military, with a clear chain of command. - CRAFTER. Working together to build a castle, or sail a ship, or manage a kitchen. - DUNGEONEER. Being a leader of a small, diverse squad of specialists means learning to harness their myriad abilities quickly and effectively. - SAGE. Researchers drift between having laser focus on a particular subject, and being easily distracted by a new fascination. It's up to you to keep them on task, but also to take their wanderings seriously, because it could lead to new insights and discoveries. - SNEAK.

STRATEGY, CIVILIZATION, ENTRAPMENT Not only seeing an opportunity to take advantage of the current situation, but quickly drafting up a plan and having it executed, and awareness of what situations could cause your enemy to do the same. CRAFTS, RESEARCH, INSIGHT Being assigned teams who will perform specialized work on your behalf is often improved if you actually know what they're talking about. COGNIZANCE, EMPATHY, MEDIATION You're not infallible.

They may have been promoted to supervise other architects and builders, and relish the day that they can finally stop being the punching bag for why construction hasn't gone as smoothly or quickly as hoped. They may even pull on their strings from the shadows, their commands so subtle, so nuanced, that their 'subjects' even believe it was their own idea. Do they covet power?

Being able to effectively distribute labor, and make the most of your allies' efforts, can make your life a lot easier. Characters who are Crafters tend to be opinionated. There is often a right answer to a situation or problem, some tool or technique that's considered standard, or something you scoff at and blow off, since your way is better.

This is either during, the result of, or leading to the first major action sequence, which should also establish what the OBJECTIVE of the story is. THE MONTAGE Once established, the characters move through a series of challenges, one after another, at a breakneck speed, seemingly unstoppable in their skill and talents. These challenges should be drawn as a result of pass-to-the-next, or draw-from-a-hat order of challenges that are practically tailor-made to be solved by this particular crew. This is a major opportunity for each of the characters to showcase their abilities, and possibly introduce additional elements of their backstory or personality. THE SETBACK The characters experience failure or defeat, possibly for the very first time, or a sudden betrayal, or boiling over of conflict between members of the group. Tensions should be raised, and all hope seem lost, as the true scope of their task looms in front of them. Nevertheless, the characters find some shared or personal reason to press on. THE FINALE After another series of challenges, the final objective is now achieved, through skill, a fatal enemy mistake, or even an act of extreme absurdity. The day one, the spoils looted and distributed (maybe), the dead buried, each character either departs the group, or together walks off into the sunset, and on to the possibility of future as-yet-untold adventures. ACTION ROLES: - The Hero: A dashing rogue with a heart of gold. Is usually the glue holding the group together. - The Antihero: Doesn't want to be in the group. They said so. Plays by their own rules. - The Romantic: Will often be the voice of reason, or a love interest. De-escalates tensions. - The Innocent: This may be a member of the crew, or a character picked up along the way. They often have some kind of insight or expertise that's surprisingly helpful, but their VIP nature often means keeping them alive at all costs. - The Driver: Delivers the crew to scene, master of the getaway vehicle and chase scene, probably can drive anything. Alternatively, the guy who knows a guy to get you in. - The Heavy: Uses weapons. Big ones. They usually don't care what the mission is, so long as they get to use those weapons. - The Sniper: Precision artisan, meticulous, calculating. Is often perceived as less trustworthy than the others. - The Acrobat: A ninja in just about every sense of the word, they bring a graceful flair to what otherwise amounts to gratuitous violence. - The Loose Cannon: Sometimes a demolitions expert, their somewhat unhinged enthusiasm is prone to getting them, and everyone around them, into trouble. ACTION MECHANICS: - Big Bomber: A single item or payoff strategy can be built up or acquired over the adventure, which will instantaneously succeed one skill check scenario, guaranteed, with flying colors. - Brute Force: Problems and obstacles that should ordinarily not be solvable with violence, are. Driving through walls, shooting blast doors shut, launching via explosions, etc. - Tis a Fleshwound: None of the injuries acquired during the adventure are lethal for long.","tags":["Tales","MovieMonster"]},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/CONSTRUCTING%20A%20STORY/TALES/DARK%20LORD/","title":"DARK LORD","text":"<p>DEFINE - VILLAIN - WORLD - SCHEME - HOPE</p> <p>AT THE END OF EVERY CHAPTER DRAW A CARD IF THE CARD IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DARK LORD OR HIS SCHEME, HIS GOALS PROGRESS, AND HE ADDS A NEW CARD TO THE DECK</p> <p>THE MORE CARDS HE HAS WHEN YOU CONFRONT HIM, THE HARDER THE DICE ROLL WILL BE</p> <p>EVERY CARD BELONGING TO THE DARK LORD YOU FLIP BECOMES A WEAPON YOU CAN USE AGAINST HIM IN THE FINAL FIGHT</p> <p>so, his cards were  [The Villain]: The Remedy, as an Event [The Scheme]: Order, inverted, as an Item [The World]: a Spirit (draw a card) as a (draw another card), ends up being a Spirit of The Void, and The Sun Inverted [The Hope]: The Forge, as a Person</p> <p>based on all of this I got:</p> <p>Our story is set in the distant future, one of bleak, sterile surfaces aboard a space station, while much of what remains of humanity rots at the hands of disease down on the planet below Our hero, or someone close to them, has contracted the disease, which is sure to wash across the station like a tide if they don't execute the infected first, as is procedure Our character has heard tell that there may be medicine, a cure, if you go through the black markets and avoid the 'proper channels', and the objective is to get in touch with the person who manufactures the vaccination before their infected status is discovered.</p>","tags":["Tales","MovieMonster"]},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/CONSTRUCTING%20A%20STORY/TALES/MOVIE%20MONSTER/","title":"MOVIE MONSTER","text":"<p>Monster movies, or Slashers, borrow a lot of elements from both Action and Horror.

It's only when it's too late to back out, do they finally realize that they're trapped in a spider's web, that very much wants them dead. MONSTER DO While the characters move from location to location, shoring up defenses, making repairs, and trying to accumulate enough Discovery successes to be allowed to leave, the monster is on the prowl. It'll use whatever means at it's disposal to track, stalk, ambush, chase, and destroy. WHO TRAPPED WHO After becoming familiar with the layout of the Theatre and it's various stages, it's time to set traps, rig distractions, or heft a really, really big weapon. This cinematic head is the most dangerous thus far, and someone may have to sacrifice themselves just to create a last opportunity for anyone to escape alive. There may even be a false end, where things seem resolved, but the slasher miraculously surges back to the fore. ESCAPE TO DAYLIGHT With the monster trapped or dead behind them, any surviving characters stumble back to a place of relative safety. They may tell others about their tale, or arm up just to come back and finish the job for good, but that's mostly beyond the scope of this tale. MONSTER ROLES: - THE INNOCENT: This may be a member of the crew, or a character picked up along the way. They often have some kind of insight or expertise that's surprisingly helpful, but their VIP nature often means keeping them alive at all costs. - THE FRONTLINER: This role is often a headstrong militant type. Their first, and often only strategy is to attack the monster head-on, shooting it, running it over, or stabbing it. Beyond that, they'll try to stay armed, more out of habit than for any real effectiveness against the enemy. The rest of the team can choose to give some of their cards to the Frontliner, in the hopes that they'll take the lead, and that those cards will actually amount to something. - THE ENGINEER: A specialist through and through, the Engineer proves their worth in the field, juryrigging resources, repairing broken engines or opening doors. Extremely practical, their efforts give the crew an enormous leg up in terms of turning their environment around, so that it doesn't work against them so badly. Turns active penalties, such as darkness, into advantages. - THE SCHOLAR: Their interests are almost purely academic, but they're usually just as fascinated by their circumstances as they are terrified of the danger. They'll whip up strategies, and produce various invaluable nuggets of trivia that means the crew won't have to rely on guessing as much. Using devices, and batteries, they can replicate any other role, but only once. MONSTER MECHANICS: - TICK TOCK: Whenever a span of time occurs, such as searching for clues, entering a room, or hiding, roll a d20. On a 20, the monster appears; if not, the threshold drops by 1. On an appearance, a successful Perception/Initiative check may grant the party an opportunity to do something first. - LOST HEARTBEAT: Rather than health, a standard deck of playing cards is doled out to the party, shuffled and face down. Whenever the monster appears, whoever gets attacked, either the Frontliner or someone at random, reveal cards one at a time until a red card is revealed, indicating that, somehow, this time, the character has survived. If no red cards have been revealed and the character runs out of cards, that character has been killed.

These questions can come about suddenly, or as the result of more observant characters who noticed something was amiss, and are determined to get to the bottom of things. GATHER CLUES By seeking out evidence, either in different locations or held by other characters, or following a lead presented by evidence, the characters start to piece together the puzzle of what it is that has transpired here. Sometimes, evidence leads to a dead end, and sometimes it can set you on the wrong path altogether, a 'red herring', that needs to be noticed and reexamined. Once all the available information has been gathered and arranged, it may present a narrative, most commonly defined by a Motive. THE TWIST Satisfied that the mystery is solved and wrongs are righted, one final stumbling block appears: something that was once known to be true, is now discovered to have been false, and this new information completely unravels the rest of the theory. But this falsehood is, in itself, a new clue, one that points to the truth when followed. MYSTERY SOLVED Having pursued the twist to its inevitable conclusion, the case is closed. Criminals are behind bars, victims avenged, a device activated, or a puzzle solved, the characters are now free to return to their lives, or push onward to the next adventure.

This usually means weapons and projectiles, but can also be a barricade to prevent the motion of people or animals.</p> <p>A shield: - Is often made of metal, wooden planks, or a mix of both, but can be any sturdy and durable material - Is often broad, to ensure that as much of a target is blocked as possible, as well as to more evenly distribute force across its face - Will generally have handles and/or straps to better affix the shield to the hand or arm - Can be in many shapes and sizes, which, along with patterns painted on the face, can be a signifier of origin or allegiance - Medium shields are usually 4-5lbs, but larger shields can be 6-14lbs</p> <p>Proper shield techniques require SHIELD USE proficiency, but training in the unique abilities associated with each weight of shield requires DISCIPLINE.</p> <p>[[SMALL SHIELD]] - Also referred to as a [[BUCKLER]]. - Lighter and faster, making them suitable for deflection and parrying and quick blows, but not barricading, withstanding heavy weight, blocking projectiles, or protecting the lower body. - Domed, for the deflection of force away from the middle of the shield, with a handle. - Better suited to DUELs against lighter weapons like a sword or rapier. - 45cm or 18\"</p> <p>[[MEDIUM SHIELD]] - The most versatile shield, as a middle ground for size and coverage, weight, positioning, shoving, and striking. - A [[ROUND SHIELD]] is circular in shape, and may be domed for the redirection of force. Many only have a single-handle grip, which allows it to be dropped and retrieved, but lacks stability, especially against heavier attacks. Better for quick, chaotic skirmishes. - A[[KITE SHIELD]] or [[HEATER SHIELD]] protects more of the lower body with it's extended bottom flare, but the awkward shape and weight distribution means that the shield must be affixed to the arm via enarme straps. This grants it stability, especially against heavier attacks, but limits it's positioning, and cannot be dropped. Better for focused duels between fighters, and can be notched to fit lances when jousting.</p> <p>[[LARGE SHIELD]] - The most defensible, but least flexible shield, suitable for withstanding any attack from a single direction, preventing creature movements, and barricading, but not effective for pivoting or speed. - A [[RIOT SHIELD]] is made of lighter material, but is designed to prevent creature advancement more than be completely bulletproof. They often have openings that allow the user to see through the shield to what's in front of them, and will have a combination handle and quick-release strap for versatility and speed of use. - A [[PAVISE]], or [[TOWER SHIELD]], often has spikes on the bottom to plant in the ground, and is suitable to shelter behind against bombardment from projectiles, especially for a reloading archer or crossbowman. If planted firmly enough, can also be used as an obstacle.</p>","tags":["Items","ItemStyle","Shield"]},{"location":"My%20Stuff/Road%20and%20Ruin/ITEMS/EQUIPMENT/WEAPONS/TYPES%20OF%20WEAPONS/SPEAR/","title":"SPEAR","text":"<p>'Spears' refer to an item style, where a small blade is affixed to the end of a long length of wood or metal.</p> <p>The blade: - Usually made of metal, but can be made of sharpened wood, stone, bone, or glass, or even simply sharpening the end of the handle - Is more designed for piercing thrusts rather than for slicing - Can be IMPROVISED with anything suitable to be DAGGER</p> <p>The handle: - Usually made of wood, but can be any suitably long and sturdy rod - Often range from 6-8', or 1-1.5x the body height</p> <p>The main intention of spears is to be capable of striking a target at a further, safer distance.
